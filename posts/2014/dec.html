  <h2>Thanksgiving Angel</h2>

  <p>I had a wonderful Thanksgiving weekend. I hope you did as well. The Billy Joel concert was absolutely fantastic! Midway through, Sting came out and sang and then later for you baby boomers, John Mellencamp came out and sang as well. All in all, a great evening. Our Wednesday was to have been spent getting some of our shopping out of the way but the weather was so horrific (rain&gt;howling wind, turning umbrellas inside-out, sleet&gt;snow&gt; back to rain) we finally ducked in for cover at a Hard Rock Café along with the rest of Manhattan. Beloved and I began to wonder how inexpensively we could see a Broadway matinee. So while we had lunch, I scoured the internet and lo and behold, we found affordable Les Mes tickets and spent the rest of the afternoon at the theater out of the weather. The true definition of serendipitous!

  Thanksgiving Day, we found ourselves literally stuck in Manhattan due to the parade. When I say stuck, I mean literally stuck, with all exits out of the city near where we had parked the car blocked off until 2:00pm that afternoon. When a NYC policeman told us this, I stood there frozen in disbelief. Suddenly I felt claustrophobic. We were going to miss dinner in Philly? Then an 'angel' (see last post) walked up with his wife to retrieve his car from the same garage and when I told him about us all being stuck, he just looked at me and didn't say a word. He paid for his car, the car was brought up from the bowels of the garage and the next thing I knew he told us to follow them. He got in his car, rummaged around for something and then he draped his retired police badge over the rearview mirror. He then turned left (remember that the streets are closed off and it has become a pedestrian walkway) on a one way street and waited for us to pull in behind him. At each intersection cops either lifted barricades or moved their vehicles to let us both by. He waited each time for us to get through the intersections and then before you knew it we were on the very westside of Manhattan He then turned left, we turned right and were on our way to Philly. Angels come in all shapes and sizes!</p>

<h2>Words to Live By</h2>

<p>Today is the day that I travel again 45 miles east to the hospital to have a couple of things done in preparation for chemo on Thursday. One of the tests that is done every three months is an echocardiogram which is a fancy way of saying they are taking a 3-D look at my heart. Why? Well, every drug has side effects. And some side effects are simply annoying, like for instance the drug that I have been on for two years has a side effect of a constant runny nose - I kid you not. 24 hours a day, seven days a week. But unless you drive yourself crazy with that one, it won't kill you. And since I need to maintain my TSA mental sanity to scoot through the lines at the airports, I stuff my sleeves with Kleenex, wipe my nose  and keep moving on.

But there are also potential lethal side effects that come with medications and that same drug that gives me the runny nose, trastuzumab (Herceptin), also has heart failure as a side effect - like breast cancer patients don't have enough to worry about. Though uncommon, some women have had to stop this drug not because it has quit working (like it has on me) but because it was too toxic on their hearts. Seems cruel to me but that is science and the way things work. If after reading my ramblings, you learn nothing else, the wisest takeaway is that medicine, especially oncology, is just as much art as it is science, meaning there are more questions about this disease and these drugs than there are answers.

And after the echocardiogram, it will be time for the follow-up PET scan. You remember the one? The no carbohydrate, no caffeine, no alcohol diet I am on until lunchtime? I am afraid if you call me this morning, I might sound like a bear. All in the name of getting an accurate scan I suppose.

So, Thursday I will return to the hospital and meet with my oncologist to review these scans and to initiate round one of this new chemo. I was asked over Thanksgiving how long I would be on this drug and it brought to mind that many others may not understand this process. If you think of cancer being water and the chemo being the dam that holds it back, if you will, that chemo is in place until cracks form in the dam or until the dam breaks altogether. Then that chemo is stopped and another is tried. That drug becomes the dam and too it is in place until it no longer works and cracks form again. With each new chemo, theoretically, the length of time it can stave off the cancer lessens until finally there are no more chemo drugs to use on your particular disease and the cancer overwhelms the body.

The drug I will start on Thursday has only been FDA approved and on the market since February 2013. Which is a roundabout way of saying, we're nearing the end of the line of options. When I write this I am aware I am not including clinical trials which I think will be a good topic for later this week.

But today I will leave with this. I woke up thinking about Paris' motto which I have loved since the day I heard it. In Latin, <em>Fluctuat nec mergitur </em> which translated means: <p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #993300;"><strong>Tossed by the waves, she does not sink. </strong></span></p>
</p>

<h2>Words to Live By: Follow-up</h2>

<p>I know  I have said it before, but sometimes when I am able to "see" God communicating with me, it tickles me to death. After writing about Paris and the motto that I love, "tossed by waves, she does not sink," yesterday I sat down and read my devotional. This is a devotional that I would recommend to you as it was recommended to me by one of my "golden girls" (see prior blog about these girls). The book is entitled, <em>Jesus Calling: Enjoying Peace in His Presence</em>. The author is Sarah Young. It is written in daily format, 365 devotions. I have it on my kindle and have read it two years now. What I have found interesting for me is that I highlight things that mean something to me on that day. In 2013 I used a yellow highlighter. This year, 2014,  I am using blue. I like to go back and see where I was mentally/spiritually/physically by seeing what caught my eye on that same day a year ago.

So today, I read my passage after writing about being tossed by waves but not sinking and look what part of the devotional said: "You need the certainty of My loving Presence in order to weather the storms of life....the ultimate protection <strong>against sinking during life's storms </strong>is devoting time to develop your friendship with Me." Isn't that wild? When I see these links in my life, I feel like giving God a fist bump. Yes, I see you up there! I get it! So cool.</p>

<h2>All That Glitters Is Not Gold!</h2>

<p>
  My PET scan results came back and the good news is that the cancer has not spread to the lungs or the bone. The bad news is that the two liver lesions have grown and the "uptake" as it is called has doubled. OK. What is uptake? Remember the pre-procedure PET diet of no carbs/alcohol etc. prior to the scan? This is to prepare the body for the injection of the radioactive material that swims around inside your body attaching itself to areas of  what is called "high levels of metabolic activity" where cancer cells are known to hang out - replicating out of control.  In order for the test to be accurate, you want the body to be in a quiet metabolic state, not churning around and trying to digest loads of carbs. So, they ask you to avoid them for a day and then eat nothing after midnight.  Think<strong>  carbs = glucose = fuel = metabolic activity</strong>.  If I had continued to eat carbs and had washed it all down with a glass of wine before coming in for the PET test, the results could have been skewed.  So, uptake means how much of the radioactive material that particular area is absorbing. 0-2 means no cancer, the higher the number the more assuredly it is cancer with the maximum on the PET scale of 15.

  If you read radiology reports (which you would be crazy to do unless you had to)  you will see the word "brightness" often used in the reports - meaning the higher the number, the brighter the spot, the more uptake of glucose those cells are demanding.  Well, my two little buggers went from 6 and 8 last time (which was bad enough) jumping to 13. How dare they! So, last night when I was talking to my mother about the results, I found myself explaining it by saying, "they are bigger and brighter .... but that's not a good thing!" Then we laughed at the ludicrousness of it all.</p>

  <h2>Volume II</h2>

  <p>Typical infusion days go like this: I stop at the reception desk and a woman registers me; she  tells me how great I look (I think she is required to say that to one and all and she does a great job of it), I get banded; she hands me my chart  and then sends me to the infusion area for lab work. With Sabrina gone (see past blog - she left the building and she left me but that's another story) I now see one of two nurses. (There are many nurses back there but Sabrina and these two are the ones I have had most contact with.)  Instead of rolling dice to see who got me (or maybe who didn't have to get me) after Sabrina resigned,  they decided to split it down the middle; I alternate between the two. How funny is that? So, they access my port, they say: "1-2-3-I'm sorry" every time as they poke me. It seems to hurt them far more than me.  And they draw my labs.

  And then they send me back out to the front to wait to see the oncologist. Later my name is yelled out and I follow a nurse tech to the back where I am immediately weighed. I do not like this and so I take my shoes off every time as if that really makes a hill of beans difference and I leave powder marks on the scales and a trail up the hallway to my room. Every three weeks like clockwork. After vitals, today I was asked if I had been to to west Africa recently, which I told the nurse tech indeed I had and she about fainted on the spot!  These questions are  now required to be asked of all patients to assess for exposure to Ebola....earlier this week when I had my PET scan the receptionist asked me if I had been in west Africa and when I told him I had (liar) he kept on with his list of questions, never looking up, never really processing what I had just told him.  But again, I digress.

  After beloved and I picked the nurse tech off the floor and told her I had lied and that no, I had not been out of Steuben county in the past few days, she recomposed herself and continued with my vitals. She left and my cute, adorable oncologist scooted in, ALWAYS, cleansing her hands before she sits down and we go over the lab work that has come back, she does a quick assessment of me and then we go back to the infusion area for treatment.

  Today? After I was banded and handed my  chart, I looked down at its cover and do you know what I read? <strong>Volume II </strong>

  Do you know what that means to a healthcare provider? That this old gray mare has been in this place so many times, we have had to cull her chart and start over. When I told my oncologist what I had noticed, she burst out laughing and said, "Remember when there was no computer and we had to carry around volumes I, II, III etc? " Yes, I told her I remembered those days.

  She then walked me back and I had my infusion. Today it took 90 minutes and then I had to wait 90 minutes more to make sure I didn't grow two heads or show signs of Ebola or something. And then I was let go. But not before the "lung oncologist" as I call him walked by and asked me, "Has anyone given you your sugar wafers yet?" Which is a running gag as I do love them and they get gone so fast that once he went down to the 7-11 looking for some to give me and now keeps them hidden in a cabinet at the nurses' station. When I told him I had not gotten them today,  I can't tell you what he said but it was hilarious. Well, ok I will tell you sort of. He yelled out, "Well, that's just equine poop!"  He stormed out and brought them back to me. He is not my doctor. I have never seen him except in the halls.   He will tell you he wants to have nothing to do with breast cancer. Hey, neither do I but here I sit getting chemo, eating sugar wafers. Every three weeks like clockwork.</p>

  <h2>Not So Sunny Florida</h2>

  <p>We arrived on time with no delays Friday night for the annual patient safety conference that we have been attending for years. The IHI National Forum on Quality Improvement in Health Care as it is officially known now.Though it doesn't technically start until this evening, we have always come a couple of days early as this is one of Beloved's happiest places on earth, OBX not withstanding. Saturday was very warm and sunny and I laid around by the pool in a post-chemo haze. We did go to Epcott and I told Beloved I could no longer walk the park. Next thing I knew I was being pushed in my own chariot.  OK wheelchair but it doesn't sound nearly as Disneyesque..... Sunday the weather was cloudy and I laid around in bed. Today? Pouring buckets and they had the nerve to put us in a room that faces the gigantic pool and new HUGE waterslide that I would be pushing young children aside to get to if it wasn't so drippy horribly wet out there.</p>

  <p>I am having bouts of insomnia and am up watching really weird stuff on TV. I have a horrible fascination with prison life and am glued to interviews where inmates talk about prison and how they get through their days. And the food. How do they stand it? Then I watch American Greed and wonder how so many people can be duped in various ways for sooo long. I am not sure what it says about me by divulging these midnight activities. I guess I am still back at the starting gate wondering why there are eight ESPN channels and no BRAVO every hotel I go to...</p>

<h2>Clinical Trials: Part I</h2>

<p>We arrived back in snowy NY last night. I must admit I was happy to come home to cats and Christmas trees. I was frustrated not having consistent internet access where we were staying in Florida and then realized that I must have some strange addiction to this blogging as I don't have anything earth shattering to say but it keeps me out of trouble I suppose.

I wanted to talk about clinical trials as I get that question by many friends and family wondering if I should or would seek out such an option when this drug ceases to work and for me, the answer will be no. People vary widely on this subject and all I can say is that for me, I just don't want to be put through anymore. I  am at peace. But I do have work friends and family friends who said they would seek out trials at all cost if and when it ever came to such. And I respect that. I did find helpful information on the Johns Hopkins website  <a title="Johns Hopkins Breast Cancer Clinical Trials" href="http://pathology.jhu.edu/breast/trials.php" target="_blank">http://pathology.jhu.edu/breast/trials.php </a> that gave the pros and cons of such a decision. This is quoted verbatim.  I thought I would share it with you in case you have never really thought about this subject.</p>

<strong>Pros:</strong>

<ul>

  <li><strong>Quality of Care.</strong> Clinical trials offer high-quality cancer care and necessitate very close monitoring. If you are in a study and do not receive the new treatment being tested (that is, if you are in the "standard therapy group"), you will receive the best standard treatment. This may be as good as, or better than, the new approach.</li>

  <li><strong>Early access.</strong> If a new treatment approach is proven to work and you are taking it, you may be among the first to benefit.</li>

  <li><strong>Proactive.</strong> By looking at the pros and cons of clinical trials and your other treatment choices, you are taking an active role in a decision that affects your life.</li>

  <li><strong>Altruism.</strong> You have the chance to help others and improve cancer treatment for patients in the future.</li>

</ul>

<strong>Cons:</strong>

<ul>

  <li><strong>Treatment efficacy is not known</strong>. New treatments under study are not always better than, or even as good as, standard care. They may have side effects that doctors do not expect or that are worse than those of standard treatment.</li>

  <li><strong>Not everyone benefits</strong>. Even if a new treatment has benefits, it may not work for you. Even standard treatments, proven effective for many people, do not help everyone.</li>

  <li><strong>Controls receive only standard therapy</strong>. If you receive standard treatment instead of the new treatment being tested, it may not be as effective as the new approach.</li>

  <li><strong>Costs depend upon type of insurance and state</strong>. Health insurance and managed care providers do not always cover all patient care costs in a study. What they cover varies by plan and by study. To find out in advance what costs are likely to be paid in your case, talk to a doctor, nurse or social worker from the study. Congress is currently considering proposals to eliminate this barrier and require insurance coverage for cancer clinical trials.</li>

<h2>Owl Infestation</h2>

Aren't these the cutest things you have ever seen?  This is the one thing I remember my mom baking as a child that my sister and I would wait for all year. She would bake them at Halloween and we loved them. With money not so plentiful growing up, we would eat from the outside in going in a circle, saving that luscious cashew for last. I have kidded my mother for years about them and they have popped up at the oddest times and places. Like in the pre-op holding area of the OR when I was being walked back for surgery in 2010. Mom and Dad had driven up from NC (we were in Virginia at the time, remember) and as we were walking back, my mother yelled out, "Wait, just one minute. I have to show you something" and out popped her tupperware and two dozen owl eyes stared back at me. My nurse who was trying to get me back for surgery looked at me quizzically and I told her that was my mother's way showing love. "Mmmmmmm," she responded, "to a woman who has had nothing to eat since midnight." And we both laughed.

Last night we stumbled into a dark apartment and bumped into a box from an address I didn't know - "Triple Creek Farms" - I looked at Beloved and he shrugged. I didn't think I was on anyone's hit list so I took a chance and opened the box. Out sprang two dozen owls. I had an owl infestation on my hands! Beloved looked at me like, "What do owls have to do with Christmas and who sent them?" I  laughed as they were packaged two-by-two as if they were boarding an ark headed for the cold northern tundra. Each pair wrapped in a different color of tissue paper. My mother. She is one funny woman.

She now waits to call me in the morning after I have posted my blog. She says it's her way of knowing that I am up. This morning she called and I told her I had a problem (I am devilish that way as someone told me when I wrote about scaring that nurse tech about ebola - but I can't help myself). She said, "OK. What's wrong?" I told her I had an owl infestation and she hesitated for just a second before choking on her coffee she was laughing so hard. She told me she had forgotten that she sent them (huh?) that she had made the dough up at the appropriate time, Halloween, but had been too busy with her pumpkin making (another story for another day) so she froze the dough and had just gotten around to making them last week.

I must confess. I still eat them in a circle, saving that cashew for last. Some traditions are hard to break.</p>

<h2>Owl Fan Club and My New Girl Yuki</h2>

<p>Wow! I had no idea those owls had such a fan club following!   My sidekick aunt was the first one to text me to say, "ohhhhhhhhhhhhhh I had forgotten about those owl cookies!" Then later she texted me from work: <em>I want an owl cookie</em>. I could just see her at her desk with a little dabble of drool at the corner of her mouth! She then told me to eat one for her. I didn't have the heart to tell her I was munching on one as I read her message...then a family friend emailed me telling me she had enjoyed the  post and that she had several of my mother's recipes but not that one! Then several of you told me you thought it was a sweet mother story....later Friday night as I was winding down, a former work friend, whom I will be having lunch with at the OBX next week emailed and queried if any owls would be traveling south with me! Ten minutes later my stepdaughter texted me asking if Mom would be willing to show her how to bake them while we are all at the OBX for Xmas. I told her definitely. By the way since you asked, they are peanut butter cookies in the middle with a chocolate rim around them. I know. It makes them even more adorable.

By the way, guess what I ordered last week? Well let me back up. We have two German cars that we have named Helga and Heidi based on their size. Well, last week we added a sister to the family. A real go getter with all wheel drive (just in time my Corning friends told me laughing, since this is our third winter here and we have been sliding through each winter so far - we came back from Orlando with six inches on the ground)  and since she is Japanese, I had to look for a suitable name....well I named her Yuki which is Japanese for snow. (I think that I am oh so clever) but now she needs an appropriate license plate don't you think? OBXMAS it is. When I explained it to the DMV lady, she told me she liked it very much. So there!</p>

<h2>Again, All That Glitters Is Not Gold</h2>
<p>In the 1980's there was widespread adoption of a new treatment for late state  breast cancer which included high dose chemotherapy along with autologous (meaning your own) bone marrow transplant. Haven't ever heard of it? Let me tell you why. 
  A woman by the name of Nelene Hiepler Fox was in late stage breast cancer and desired this treatment modality. Her health care
  insurance however declined coverage for it.  Her estate ended up winning a $89 million dollar suit against the insurance company. 
  This was considered a watershed case and subsequently, health insurers began to approve this treatment. And guess what? Insurance
  companies were forced to pay for this treatment despite the fact that there had been no clinical trials done on this regimen
  (chemo/bone marrow transplant combination).  In the end?
</p>
<ul>
  <li><span style="color: #ff0000;">42,000 women ended up having this treatment done to the tune of <strong>$3.4 billion dollars</strong></span></li>
  <li><span style="color: #ff0000;">9000 women died <strong>from the treatment</strong></span></li>
</ul>
When a randomized clinical trial was finally conducted in 1999, it found that this regimen was <strong>no better</strong> than
conventional treatment.

<h2>Research and Pharmaceutical Companies</h2>
<p>Mom and I were talking yesterday and she commented on not knowing about the chemo/bone marrow transplant story. I told her
I wouldn't expect her to nor most people who read the blog which is why I want to share things I know or have learned from working
in patient safety for so many years. Today, I need to share about industry-sponsored research/clinical studies. Did you know:</p>
<ul>
  <li><span style="color: #ff6600;">The pharmaceutical industry underwrites about 75% of clinical research</span></li>
  <li><span style="color: #ff6600;"> Many of the scientists and clinicians responsible for the trial receive compensation from the pharmaceutical firm in the form of salary or consulting fees</span></li>
</ul>
Do you remember the drug Vioxx (rofecoxib)? It was approved by the FDA on May 20, 1999. Worldwide, over 80 million people were prescribed this drug. It was used as a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug. In January 1999  Merck launched the "Vioxx GI Outcomes Research" (VIGOR) study comparing  rofecoxib and naproxen (one of its competitors). One of the things they found was a  4-fold increased risk of acute myocardial infarction in rofecoxib patients when compared with naproxen patients. But they hid this information from the public and people began to die. So, what did the Merck corporation do? Immediately recall the medication? Not hardly...

In 2001, Merck’s sales force developed a flashcard game called “Dodge Ball Vioxx” to help train Merck sales representatives on how to respond to certain questions or concerns that doctors might have about Vioxx. The game included a 12-page list of obstacles including some questions concerning the association between Vioxx and heart problems. The flashcards gave statements that a physician or patient might state like, "I have heard that Vioxx causes heart problems." And the flashcard would explain to the sales rep what the best answer to that question would be  - all the while<em> dodging </em> the real issues.  On September 30, 2004, Merck voluntarily withdrew rofecoxib from the market.

<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">The FDA estimates that  60,000 died from taking Vioxx before it was removed from the market.</span></p>

  <p>If you are alone during the day like I am and the cats are tired of chatting with you, your mind wanders. At least mine does. This is what I have been ruminating about this week:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>How can Angelina Jolie know everything about the BRCA gene, lop off her breasts but somehow get chicken pox?</li>
      <li>How can NBC let Nancy Snyderman (<em>Dr. Nancy</em> as she is affectionately known - gag me) back on the air after the internet backlash she received for ignoring her quarantine when she returned from West Africa?</li>
      <li>If you mistakenly pour tequila into your tonic water, thinking it is gin, do not throw it out. Actually, it is rather quite tasty. You will have to trust me on this one.</li>
      <li>Don't you think you can tell a lot about a person based on how they decorate the back of their Christmas tree??</li>
      <li>Why would anyone make a movie about North Korea in the first place?</li>
      <li>Why when a clothes dryer lint compartment caught on fire years ago at my hospital, did they make my friend the
        <em>Infection Control</em> Director write a policy about cleaning out the lint on a regular basis? (I told you, I
        have been bored and my mind wanders.)</li>
      <li>Why won't people get as upset about handwashing as they are about getting Ebola?</li>
      <li>Why won't people get as upset about the flu shot as they are about getting Ebola?</li>
      <li>Why when you go to a party or reception do they serve so many raw vegetables? Do you notice no matter how good the dip, there will be several hundred pounds of vegetables laying around on limp lettuce when everyone starts going home? Am I the only person who hates the word "veggie?" Just wondering...</li>
      <li>If you think these ramblings are those of a mad woman, please keep it to yourself. Only because I made that promise to the TSA lady and I have travel plans in the upcoming months.</li>

  <h2>A Little More On Research and Medical Literature</h2>
  <h3>December 19th, 2014</h3>
  <p>I had many texts, emails and conversations about the clinical trial blog along with the Vioxx blog that made many of
    you nervous. That was not my intent but it was my intent to illuminate some of the things going on around you that
    impact the decisions your caregivers make, the drugs that you take, the ads that you see on the evening news. I am
    aware that these blogs are written in sort of a "sound bite" way  - quick shocking facts that don't allow for dialogue
    which we could have if we were sitting down or if we were in a classroom situation. But I thought I would write one
    more blog on things going on in healthcare, knowing that I am only scratching the surface with this topic.  So, here
    we go again. I have always found these statistics fascinating:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>There are over 20,000 bio-medical journals in circulation</li>
      <li>150,000 articles are published each month in these journals; <strong>t</strong><b>hat’s 5,000 articles per day!</b></li>
      <li>Many of the research articles are not peer-reviewed</li>
      <li>Many articles are sponsored by the pharmaceutical companies or device manufacturers</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The question is, if you were an internist, how could you possibly keep up a practice and live a life outside the office/hospital and even begin to keep up with the research in your chosen field (not to mention any subspecialty you have the you would be interested in)? But just because something is published, it doesn't mean it's good. Just like you pick and choose your food at the market, so should healthcare providers be picky in choosing what they believe when they read something.

    In an article several years ago in the Journal of Association of the American Medical Association (JAMA), an author took 49 highly cited studies (meaning they were referenced and quoted many times in many other scholarly publications). Of those 49, in later research, 32% of those articles had refuted findings. 16% contraindicated the effects of whatever was found in those studies and another 16% overestimated the effects of the studies.

    When you hear the phrase on TV or in a magazine at the doctor's office  "randomized clinical trials" does that mean anything to you? In the medical world, it is the gold standard by which research is conducted. It means that participants are randomly chosen to be in either the control group or the experimental group. The only expected difference between these two groups is the 'thing' that you are researching.  Then why isn't every study conducted this way? Because it is expensive to conduct in both time and money among many other reasons.

    Only 53% to 57% of major therapeutic interventions can be supported by  randomized clinical trials. Meaning many therapy modalities that are being conducted all day everyday around the world have been researched in less rigorous ways.

    Just like the old adage, "Don't believe anything you hear and only half of what you see." Same goes with new treatments, new drugs, new medical devices.

  <h3>December 31st, 2014</h3>
  <p>Happy New Year to All:

  Lest you thought my week of silence was because I walked out into the Atlantic never to return, I must confess it was much less dramatic than that. We did arrive in the OBX last Saturday. Family came on Sunday and we hung out until Christmas when Mom and Dad arrived. My nephew made his famous Boy Scout "turkey in a trash can" and yes, that is exactly what it is. Just imagine what other great things the Boy Scouts are teaching the youth of America. No, that was not my first but my third turkey in a can as we call it and unless you have tried it, don't knock it!  My step kids came the day following Christmas and we had 14 in all at any given time. We ate, fought about what movie to watch (Princess Bride, Good Morning Vietnam won along with some crazy movie where a raccoon is the pilot of some sort of aircraft - my attention at that point had waned!)

  It was so good to see all of my family including a rascally kitten of Cupcake's named Max that stole the hearts of everyone there and raced around like only a kitten could, to keep everyone on their toes.

  The part about the holidays that I didn't expect was that the new chemo whipped me but good. Usually you have a couple of bad days and then you bounce back - you are still fatigued but you can say, "Whew. I got through that one." The problem with this chemo was that there was no getting over it. It hung around like an unwanted guest.

  Everyone was gone by Sunday. Beloved announced to me and members of my family that I was not going to be staying at the OBX as long as I thought nor would I be attending the Fillipo (mom-in-law and pop-in-law party in Philly on New Year's Day as I had hoped.) Beloved drove me back Monday so I could rest and prepare for my son to arrive on Friday from NC. And also be seen sooner by my oncologist.

  Yesterday we journeyed on to the hospital. I was supposed to have had treatment on Christmas day but it was delayed until this upcoming Friday. However, with me never getting over the 'bad days' Beloved decided I needed to be seen ASAP. The good news is I got in on Tuesday. The bad news is that I am told the side effects will not get any better, nor will I have some good treatments and some bad treatments like I was used to in Virginia. The side effects are what they are and they will be continuous. We opted for another round of chemo yesterday agreeing that we would have a serious sit-down talk in three weeks to decide what, if anything can be done. I think it comes down to whether to push through it or  stop. Unlike the past two times with chemo, there were definite rounds to a treatment cycle. So, I could count them down knowing that there was an end in sight. With this regimen, there is no end.  Today as I write, I am not sure which way I will go.</p>
