  <h2>An Important Person I Missed When Talking About The OBXmas</h2>
  <h3>November 3rd, 2014</h3>

  <p>So, it dawned on me in my eagerness to talk about OBXMAS, I neglected to mention my sister who has made her way out to the edges of NC from Winston-Salem (5 1/2 hours away) for the past couple of years to celebrate with us. Note: Don't forget about your blood relatives! She is far too kind to text me and say, "Hey, what gives?" She knows my mind is a sieve now and doesn't give me a hard time.  We started this new tradition when we bought the OBX house and my mother moved to Raleigh from W-S. Though sometimes tough, traditions do  change throughout time; I didn't think I would manage to live life without my grandmother's dressing at Thanksgiving but somehow I've managed (though I still miss it and hope she has a big dish of it for me in heaven when I see her).
My mother hosted Christmas for many, many years but life has changed and we now have Christmas at the beach. The first year, I had been given a golf cart by the one who does not want to be mentioned because although we live very near the ocean, it is still far enough walk for me that once I get to the water, I am too tired to walk the beach. So, last year, it was a cold but sunny Christmas day and my sister and I thought we would take a ride on the cart and then walk the beach. We bundled ourselves up, made Manhattans, put one in our mother's hand (she is fun watch when she drinks these on a rare occasion) placed her in the cart and off we went. Actually we were chauffeured to the beach (by the unmentionable one)  and the three of us in the back of the cart were jiggled, wiggled and sloshed to the beach.  He likes to drive 'fast' in the cart and sling his passengers around. If you get in the golf cart, put a lid on your drink and hang on.  You have been warned.  Until two years ago, I couldn't have imagined an oceanic holiday; now I can't imagine not having one.

My sister is a good cook and extremely handy. When she arrives, she is bearing all kinds of good things to eat - especially the 'top of the stove' cookies that we ate as kids until we made ourselves sick. Did you make them when you were young? In our house, we always had the ingredients around - even if we didn't have other things to eat (cocoa, milk, butter, oatmeal, peanut butter and sugar). The first time my husband ate them, he went crazy. He prays for them now every year. She does not disappoint. She also quietly goes around my house, tightening loose things, hammering loose boards - she notices things I do not because she is an architectural restorer by trade. Every time she leaves, my kitchen is stocked with snacks and the house is in better shape.
For the past two years, it has been my husband, me, my sister and parents - a smaller gathering than we have ever had but it has been peaceful. We took our time opening gifts, ate dinner slowly and had a really great time.  I hope my sister will attend the larger Fillipo gathering this Christmas. It will be a different day for sure but if the weather is good, we will still make our way to the water, Manhattans in hand.</p>

  <h2>TSA Adventure</h2>

  <p>I had an adventure yesterday. You see, since my beloved and I still travel fairly often, I get irritated when I see him scoot through the "TSA-pre check" line while I stand back in the back with the folks who have never been on an airplane before or the woman who is trying to carry on a gallon of milk. And while he is through security, I am still standing there ten people back from the conveyor and it makes me crazy. Well, I shouldn't use that word. In a minute, I will tell you why.

For those who avoid planes, by being pre-checked it means you can leave your sweater and coat on, your shoes on and you don't have to take out your laptop nor your little teeny tiny fluids from your bag. In larger airports, they have a separate line and you can jet right through. It can often make a world of difference in flying...

So if you look on the TSA-pre check website, you will find locations where you can go and if you can spare $85 and have a valid passport, they can grill you like you are being charged with a crime and then tell you in 21 days, you will become what is called a 'known traveler' and then you too can scoot through the line with all your clothes on.  So the closest site is in Rochester, NY, 90 miles away which is a good distance except it is a beautiful, bucolic drive through the mountains. So off I went.

I gave myself ample time because twice now I have been to Rochester and have lost GPS capability and gotten lost once I reached the city. So I wanted to make sure that I did not waste  a trip for nothing thinking that TSA folks probably aren't the most flexible people in the world. When I arrived, I thought I was late to a party. There were a dozen people already waiting (I was smart enough to have gotten an appointment but I didn't feel like it would make much difference looking at this crowd.)  I waited a half hour while all these rough and tumble men in the waiting room talked about their war stories in traveling, each one trying to out do the other. I  thought about jumping into the fray and blowing them all away with my travel stories but I demurred.

When it was my turn, I walked into an office where the clerk had a computer, I had a monitor and off we went. I had to verify and re-verify my identify, all the names I had ever used. I had to type in my social security number twice (she is sitting there with all this information - I think it was just a test to make sure I knew everything??) Then I was fingerprinted - all ten of them. And finally I had to read the monitor and affirm what I had already done prior to my arrival. Oh yes, I had already completed the pre-check form at home and it had been emailed to them. I had to verify that I had not been convicted of a crime etc. etc and then I had to confirm that I was not mentally insane. I sat there for a moment, thinking, "Well, sometimes I feel like I am losing my mind." But trust me when I tell you she wasn't the type that wanted to hear about anyone's cancer saga, so I looked her straight in the eye and said, "I am not insane."

I was then shown on the screen one last statement and I had to verify it with signature. It stated something to the effect, "If after 48 hours of leaving this office, you find yourself mentally insane, you must notify this office."  I thought, "You know  - you would be the first person I would call. Forget my husband, my mother, my oncologist, darn it all - I will call you, TSA lady. Can I have your direct dial number?"</p>

  <h2>Marcia Strassman</h2>

  <p></a>
  &nbsp;

  Do you remember the actress Marcia Strassman? If the name is not familiar to you, if you were watching TV in the '70s like I was, she played the wife on <em>Welcome Back Kotter</em>. She was also in the movie <em>Honey I Shrunk the Kids. </em>(I would have uploaded a younger photo of her but they were too expensive!)

  Katherine O'Brien is a blogger who writes about having cancer as well. She posted a recent blog and I wanted to show you a quote from it.  I know I am preaching to the choir as they say, but it again delivers that most important message:

  <blockquote>Although Strassman freely acknowledged her Stage IV diagnosis, not a single news report used the phrases “Stage IV” or “metastatic” breast cancer. I hope I don’t sound petty–to her grieving friends and family I am sure this is a small point and one that unfortunately does nothing to alleviate their loss. But it is so important....saying that Marcia Strassman died of breast cancer <strong>after living with it for seven years somehow implies she died because she let her guard down and WHAM! breast cancer got her....this is not what happened. When someone dies from breast cancer, they died because the cancer spread beyond the breast and eventually overwhelmed the body </strong>(emphasis mine).</blockquote>

  Unusual for breast cancer patients, she was diagnosed at Stage IV from the beginning when it was found in her bones. As Katherine O'Brien said in her blog, if there is such a thing as a metastatic breast cancer continuum, she was on the "good" end with it only in her bones for such a long time.  Marcia Strassman was 66.

  <h2>I Don't Want to Leave A Mess</h2>

  <p></a>
  &nbsp;
  Remember when I told you I had seen a therapist after I couldn't quit crying when a co-worker died at work? (See the post <em>Homework</em> if not). I had forgotten this conversation with the therapist until I went into our spare bedroom just now and it reminded me... After I had gotten the co-worker story out, I was in the midst of talking to the therapist  about all sorts of things when I mentioned to her off-handedly that I had been cleaning out the drawers in our guest bathroom. "You know what I mean. All those old lipsticks and bottles of half-used lotion." She smiled at me quizzically. "I mean, I don't want to die and leave behind a mess." I was serious and she giggled. "Do you hear yourself? You are dying of cancer and you are worried about the mess someone will be left with after you are gone?"

  "Yes," I laughed back. "I am very concerned what people will think who might venture into my drawers and closets. I don't want to leave a bad impression."

  One of my friends thinks I am a very neat and organized person. She will be the one trying to help out and she will look up and say, "She fooled us all. She's just a dirty, little packrat." Somebody else will pull out a sweater or something off a hangar and will say, " Well, getting on the show  <em>What not to Wear</em> should have been on her bucket list instead of going snowmobiling."

  I can't let that happen. So in the midst of doing a little writing, fixing dinner at night, I clean out a drawer here, throw away something there - after all, I want to leave a good impression.

  <h2>Déjà Vu All Over Again</h2>

  <p>I knew this day would come but had not been looking forward to it. You see, I have been working per diem for Surgical Services updating their patient education materials for several months now. They  allow me to work from home as I can, when I can and for that I will be forever grateful. Some days I actually rack up 3 or 4  hours! That's a big day - it doesn't happen often. I am not sure how many education sheets I have to update but let's guess maybe 75-100. In my former life I was a general surgery operating room nurse. In large ORs you typically specialize and I loved doing 'big belly cases' as we call them - bowel resections, gall bladders back in the day when they were big surgeries not the little tiny outpatient surgery that it is now....but I digress. I was asked if I would start with general surgery and work my way through the other specialties like vascular, OBGYN, etc. Of course.

My first job was to alphabetize the cases so I could keep better track of what I was doing so I have been slogging through the "A's" abscesses (!), appendectomies, through the "H's" like hemorrhoidectomy. Do you now see how much fun I have sitting here alone in my apartment trying to write on the 6th grade level (which is what is needed when writing for the public, did you know?) trying to explain what will happen when you finally have your hemorrhoids taken care of?!<a

Today I got to the "M's" -  I have been dreading this like you wouldn't believe. Today I have to update the  "mastectomy" patient education sheet.  I'd rather do anything than this. I remember in Virginia when I was talking to my general surgeon as we discussed my surgical options. He at that point did not know I had scrubbed in on dozens of mastectomies, double mastectomies, and breast biopsies. I had augmented them, reduced them and turned them every way but inside-out.  I could tell he was trying to gingerly dance around what I already knew was getting ready to happen in a few weeks. And  I finally said, " I worked as an operating room nurse in general surgery for many years." The look on his face immediately changed and he said, "Oh.........................you know then................" Yes I am afraid I do.

Well, I have postponed this inevitable patient education form as long as I can. So I will stop this blogging and start the update. It feels like deja vu all over again......................</p>

  <h2>Talbots Love Affair: It Had to End</h2>

  <p>&nbsp;
  Well, over the weekend I continued to clean up and clean out, if you know what I mean. I had to laugh at some of the emails and texts I got after that post about not leaving a mess. I don't know why it really struck a chord. My own aunt texted me and called me "weird" which tickled me  because that is about the dirtiest word I think she has ever uttered! No, not the sidekick aunt I wrote about but my older, more reserved aunt (who I still get a kick out of) and who I know was just teasing me.

  OK: true confession. I love Talbots, always have, always will. I love that red door just about as much as I love the red doors on Episcopal churches. For all of my professional life, I could walk in Talbots, choose clothes off the rack, put them on and they would  fit like a glove. When we lived in Connecticut, we actually lived near a Talbots outlet!!! Oh, the bargains I bought. Loved, loved, loved it. At the time and up until November 2012, I could justify a non-sale item at Talbots because I worked in an environment that required that I dress the part - especially in Connecticut. Those women dressed to take out the trash.

  Last spring, when I was not working, I knew it was time to 'let go'  both figuratively and literally. And for all the many ways I have been able to free and release myself with  this cancer diagnosis, giving away my professional clothes was the one thing I could not do. I made my better half use those vacuum sucking bags and I had a virtual Talbots store vacuum packed in my closet last year. All spring and summer, I would look at that tower of clothing and this weekend, when I got caught in a brief snow shower wearing a thin long sleeved shirt, I knew it was time to release those clothes from their vacuumed state, keep a few and release the rest to those who have a job and could really use some nice clothes.

  The one thing that finally allowed me to take the plunge is that my younger stepdaughter, the one I nicknamed "Cupcake" several years ago, is getting ready to graduate from Temple University in the spring and is headed toward a DPT degree (cupcake, did I abbreviate it correctly?) The kids have been kidding me for months as I can't get it out - a Doctorate of Physical Therapy...DPT. It just sounds like an immunization to me but anyway).....she is in need of some work clothes, interviewing clothes and we talked about me giving her some. That was my catalyst this weekend. I began by telling myself I was setting aside things for Cupcake. And then before I knew it, I was able to acknowledge that a.) I was no longer working outside the apartment, b.)I couldn't fit in most of the pants anyway, thank you very much and c.) she needed some of my blazers.

  I have finally done it. I have winnowed my clothes, thrown away things that might embarrass me posthumously and arranged everything by color. Yes, that helps me seeing things in their rainbow glory. So, if you came into my closet now, I would be proud....but the drawers, now that's another matter altogether.......</p>

  <h2>Naked Both Coming and Going</h2>

  <p>
  &nbsp;
  Let me tell you how funny I think God can be. I really mean it. So my routine in the mornings is that I stumble to the coffee and then I sit down for a few minutes. I watch a little bit of news and then see if there are any emails. Then I make my way over to our computer (all of this is in one large room). I re-read the blog that I am going to post and then I hit the submit button. I sit back down on the couch with another cup of coffee and have my devotional. All of this can transpire from 30 minutes to three hours. Don't think I am up scurrying around like a squirrel hiding nuts. That would be my golden girls if you read that post. I am one slow woman in the morning - both pre and post cancer. Just so you know...........

  Yesterday after I posted the Talbots blog, I began reading my devotional. Several times a month I add something that I found called "scripture typer" which is just an electronic  way to actually memorize scripture. You choose what verses you want to commit to memory and then every month, it reminds you it's time to see if they have remained in your long term memory (oh my). Of the ones that I needed to review, today up popped this one: "Naked you came into this world and naked you shall leave. Blessed be the name of the Lord." I almost wet my pants and I know most people don't think the book of Job as being terribly funny but I thought God was saying, "Indeed young lady. You will not be needing your tower of Talbots clothing where you are going. Now, go and giveth those clothes away."</p>

  <h2>Elizabeth Edwards</h2>

  <p>I have a file folder on my computer where I keep articles that have impacted me and today I began thinking about an article written by Gale Suilk entitled <em>Re-learning the lessons of Elizabeth Edwards'</em> <em>death</em>. <a title="Elizabeth Edwards" href="http://blog.oup.com/2011/03/edwards-cancer/" target="_blank">http://blog.oup.com/2011/03/edwards-cancer/</a>  It is coming upon the 4th year of her death. I don't know about you but it doesn't seem possible to me. If you will recall, she was diagnosed with metastatic breast cancer while her husband John Edwards was running for president. She kept it quiet for the sake of his campaign and then announced it publically afterward.  There were many in the breast cancer world that thought Edwards would bring forth more conversation, more heft, if you will to the world of Stage IV cancer. But you know what happened? In my opinion, Elizabeth Edwards' voice was drowned out by the medical world.  After Edwards' announcement, her physician at the NC Breast Center went on national television and said that many women with Stage IV breast cancer "do well for many years."

  But as Dr. Susan Love (who I have quoted often and who I believe has a sympathetic but realistic philosophy) wrote soon afterward, "the average survival of women with metastatic breast cancer from the time of first appearance of the metastasis is between 2 and 3 1/2 years.  It hasn't moved that much over the years."

  <blockquote><span style="color: #000000;">Gail Suilk also wrote in her article something that resonates so deeply with me: I want to have hope for my friends and family members who are dealing with aggressive and late stage cancers. I even wish for miracles. But hope for a society wrestling with cancer wrests upon the clear acknowledgement that the only true indicator of medical progress overall would be a significant reduction in the number of deaths and vast improvements in the quality of life... currently she says the only way to survive Stage IV cancer is to die from something else.</span></blockquote>

  "A glass that is half full is also a glass that is  half empty", she states. For some of you that will irritate or you might think, "you need to stay positive."  Well, I like the raw frankness of her words. I will tell you the hardest thing for me to do when I am out in public, even when I am having treatment at the Cancer Center, is to be told to look on the bright side, that there could be a miracle, to stay positive, or be told of someone who lived 25 years with something that I don't even have! I do get worn out trying to convince friends and family that it is as bad as it sounds. I admire Elizabeth Edwards for coming forward and announcing that the disease was back and that it was terminal. You do not see 'celebrity' patients, as she was known, use such frank terms.

  <h2>Today is World Kindness Day</h2>

  <p>
  At the risk of sounding schmaltzy or cheesy this morning, I was in the middles of my routine (you know, the coffee, the news, the waking up) when I scanned <em>US Today</em> and the title of an article caught my eye, "Kid drops out of college to devote life to kindness." <a title="Acts of Kindness" href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2014/11/12/inspiration-nation-ark-project-now/18939687/" target="_blank">http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2014/11/12/inspiration-nation-ark-project-now/18939687/</a>  A young man being  interviewed said he had finished his exams and was watching a movie and at the end of the film, wise Morgan Freeman asks, Do you want to know how to change the world?  One act of random kindness at a time." Sometimes I feel it is an overused phrase but it doesn't mean that I believe the concept is overused.  So, today is world kindness day.

  For those who wish they could do something, maybe everyday instead of one day a year, there is a website that lists dozens of ways both large and small that depending upon your time, skill level and resources you will find something that might spark you into action. <a title="Random Acts of Kindness Ideas" href="http://www.randomactsofkindness.org/kindness-ideas" target="_blank">http://www.randomactsofkindness.org/kindness-ideas.</a> You can filter by cost, by category (environment, animals etc.)

  I confess that sometimes I feel quite on the outside of life. Most of the time as I have written, I am ok with it. Sometimes, I am not. Like last night at  a work function, as I looked around at my former colleagues, most of whom I also consider friends, I got so sentimental as I haven't seen them all together in long, long time. You know how these functions go. Part of the time the talk is social and part of the time it is work. I could keep up with the social but again, the work part, I only knew bits and pieces of the topics and by the time I was saying good-bye and good night, I was a tearful woman.

  After a good cry in the shower when I got home and a little unwinding I went to bed and slept like that proverbial baby. So maybe what I am really getting to is that seeing that article reminded me that  there are dozens of ways I can choose to participate in the world and it is up to me to be creative and find the ways. I just need to wipe my nose and get on with it.</p>

  <h2>Breast Cancer 101:Part 1</h2>

  <p>I was reading another blog recently and this woman was astounded when she went to a support group and she was the only one in the group who knew anything about her cancer. This made me think that for some of you, it might be helpful to explain a few terms you might read about, hear from friends or from your own doctor.

<ul>

<li>There are several types of breast cancer but the two you will most likely read about  is either ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) which means it is sitting inside the milk duct and <strong>has not invaded</strong> any other tissue. Invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC)  means the nasty bugger has invaded the surrounding tissue.  It has worked its way outside of the duct.</li>

</ul>

<ul>

<li>Once the cancer has been determined IDC or DCIS, it is "staged."   This assists doctors (along with other things) in determining treatment options.

<ul>

<li>Stage 0-1 means the tumor cells have been confined to a limited area</li>

<li>Stage 2A and 2B means that the tumor is still growing but has moved its way to the lymph nodes.  A versus B denotes the size of the tumor and whether or not it has invaded the lymph nodes. For more in depth reading on this, click on <a title="Stage 2 A and B" href="http://www.nationalbreastcancer.org/breast-cancer-stage-2" target="_blank">http://www.nationalbreastcancer.org/breast-cancer-stage-2</a></li>

<li>Stage 3A, 3B, or 3C means the tumor has extended  beyond the immediate region of the tumor itself and may have invaded nearby lymph nodes and muscles, but has not spread to distant organs.  For more information, <a title="Stage 3 A B C" href="http://www.nationalbreastcancer.org/breast-cancer-stage-3" target="_blank">http://www.nationalbreastcancer.org/breast-cancer-stage-3</a></li>

<li>Stage 4 means the tumor has spread to distant organs. The most common organs for breast cancer to spread to are the lungs, liver, bone, and brain.</li>

</ul>

</li>

</ul>

Next week, I will add more information but don't you think this is enough for one day? So, for me I had bilateral (both) IDC breast cancer meaning both tumors had begun to spread into the surrounding breast tissue. I was staged at the time as  2A, one with spread to a node, the other with no spread.  Knowing where I ended up, I bet you are surprised aren't you?</p>

  <h2>Arbitrary Weekend Updates</h2>

  <p>I should probably make this a weekly thing but at least for today I will update you on things that really don't mean a hoot as they say down south:

<ul>

<li>My aunt called to inform me that she called me a "mess" not "weird"  for writing about cleaning out my closets. That term is also very southern as I found out at Yale one day when I was talking about my son. I noticed a discomfort in the room afterward and had to backtrack until I realized that culturally they had no idea that I meant it as an endearment. The room was much kinder once we got that straight. So, yes, my aunt was being endearing and not judgmental!</li>

<li>To date, I have not lost my mind and my TSA known traveler number did arrive. Now, if I can only keep my mind intact...</li>

<li>I got a text from a friend and former colleague who thought my use of the varying phrase, "he who does not want to be mentioned" was so clever and he began to wax on about Harry Potter. Well, having never read Harry Potter, I thought he had gone off the deep end until we realized I had used that phrase innocently. He then said he was finally glad to be able to teach me something about popular culture since he had never heard of <em>Welcome Back Kotter</em>. OUCH!</li>

<li>A friend from that cocktail party this week leaned over and asked me if I had any clothes left in my closet. I think she was serious! Yes, I have more than I need and still need to cull some out.</li>

<li>My reserved aunt was fretting and finally asked me if I had least kept one Talbots outfit... for .....for.....for... I said, "My funeral?"  Yes, that's what she meant but couldn't get it out. I burst out laughing. The answer is, no.</li>

<li>My sidekick aunt thought I had made up the word "schmaltzy" in the blog about world kindness day. But she had either googled it or asked someone before she emailed me! And said, "That's a real word!" (Bless her heart. Not her fault. She has never lived nor walked amongst the northerners!)</li>

</ul></p>

  <h2>Breast Cancer 101: Part 2</h2>

  <p><ul>

  	<li>When a breast tumor is found, additional lab studies are performed on it which will guide your physicians in the type of treatment you would benefit best from. The tumor will be tested for what's called hormone receptors. The two that you need to know are estrogen and progesterone. .  If the tumor is estrogen positive, <strong>ER+</strong> that means that the tumor uses estrogen to fuel its cell growth. Same for progesterone. If positive, <strong>PR+</strong> the tumor responds to this hormone in the body.  Typical response rates to hormone therapy are as follows:</li>

  </ul>

  <ul>

  	<li>ER+ and PR+: 75-80%</li>

  	<li>ER+ and PR-: 40-50%</li>

  	<li>ER- and PR+: 25-30%</li>

  	<li>ER- and PR- : 10% or less</li>

  </ul>

  <p style="padding-left: 30px;">2.  The third important testing that is done on the tumor is determining if there is  "overexpression" meaning too much of <strong>Her2, </strong>(human epidermal growth factor receptor 2) a specific kind of protein. If positive,<strong> "Her2-positive"</strong> it means the body is  making too much protein and the tumor is using it for fuel as well. This type of cancer often grows faster, spreads to other areas more readily, and has a higher likelihood of recurring versus <strong>Her2-negative</strong> breast cancer.  25% of breast cancer patients are + for this protein.</p>

  If a woman is negative for all three, you will often see the term "<strong>triple negative</strong>" used and unfortunately, hormonal therapies for these women don't work. Triple negative breast cancer occurs in about 10-20% of diagnosed breast cancers and is more likely to affect younger people, African Americans, and Hispanics.  Triple negative breast cancer can be more aggressive and difficult to treat.  Also, the cancer is more likely to spread and recur.

  If you desire more information, I used  this website as my resource and it is quite thorough : <a title="National Breast Cancer Organization" href="http://www.nationalbreastcancer.org/about-breast-cancer" target="_blank">http://www.nationalbreastcancer.org/about-breast-cancer</a>.]]></p>

  <h2>Betty Ford</h2>

  <p>
    Recently, I was reading in <em>RealSimple</em> magazine and noted that when Betty Ford was diagnosed with breast cancer in 1974, back in the days when you didn't say the phrase "breast cancer" out loud, she received 60,000 letters from people across the US. In a Newsweek magazine article after her diagnosis in 1974, she was credited with tearing down the barriers of this hush-hush diagnosis and bringing it out into the open. She allowed the media into her hospital room (she's better than me - I would have kept them waaay out) but I get the sense she was just that kind of trailblazer. And her life continued to exemplify that. If you will recall, she acknowledged an addiction to pills and alcohol and head held high several years later, entered a rehabilitation facility to deal with her addiction.

    Clearly she did not end up having metastatic disease but I think we can all be appreciative of her ability to push this nation along and getting the disease out in the forefront. I am willing to give her the credit (but not Campbell's soup or the NFL) for  bringing breast cancer awareness to the country.

      I need to offer up a disclaimer before I start today: I love my healthcare providers. I really do. From my oncologist, to my nurse practitioner, to my infusion nurses, they have cared for me and my beloved so, so well over the past two years. But sometimes a woman's gottta whine...............



  So, I just got back from treatment. You know, the every third week date I have 45 miles east of Corning?  And I am feeling caught somewhere between savvy nurse, worn out patient, and petulant child. Not a good place to be, right?! Let me explain. Two years ago I had three symptoms that ruled my world without ceasing: nausea, fatigue and let's just say<em> GI issues</em> to put it in a nice southern term. That's what led my oncologist to order scans, which showed spread to the liver and the rest is history.....in the past two years, each of those little thorns has been bothering me but a lot like that carnival game whack-a-mole as soon as one would rear its ugly head, the other one would duck....until about a month ago where they all decided to take up residence in my body at the same time. Without ceasing.


  <p style="text-align: left;">That's when my oncologist wanted me to get an upper endoscopy. No, thank you I said politely. And not to be from the south, she was very southern in her backdoor approach to twisting my arm but I stood firm. I have seen those done and I do not care to have one done on me since I know what I think is causing the problem. So she and I did a little healthcare bargaining. If I had a PET scan done and it showed nothing, would I then consider the upper  endo? Yes, I agreed. Well, you know what the scan showed, two lesions in my liver starting to act up. You know that gross commercial about mucus - that green gunky animal looking thing? That's what I think those lesions look like wreaking havoc in my liver but I digress.</p>

  So, today it was my turn to see the nurse practitioner. An incredibly bright, thorough nurse. I like her very much but when she asked me how I was doing, I told her that the three amigos were back and I felt the next PET scan would show increased numbers. (That was the savvy nurse talking.) She then said, "But if you are nauseous and not eating, that could lead to GI troubles which could be making you nauseous....." She was telling me I was putting myself in a vicious cycle and that she wanted me to have the upper endo to see if something else was causing my symptoms. I turned to the one who will not be named and he stayed silent. Then I turned into the weary patient and started crying, "No, I really think it is my liver. I am so tired of this.....two years....every three weeks..." She relented. "OK, but if the next PET scan shows no progress, can we come back to the table with the endo?" I told her yes and then confessed I had stopped taking one of my oral meds when I ran out and as soon as I ran out, my headaches stopped with it. So then she says, "OK. When the PET scan comes back with no progression, will you have the endo <strong>and</strong> start back on the med?" (Here comes the petulant child.)

  "Yes" I said, "But I am telling you like I have told Dr. xxxx, the first hot flash I get (a side effect) I am either throwing myself out the window, or the drugs, or both."

  "Fair enough," she said. She was so poised and so wise and I sat there like a triumphant child after a tantrum. Oh my.</p>

  <h2>BRCA1 &amp; BRCA2: Why Angelina Jolie Makes Me Crazy</h2>

  <p>
    OK. Right off the bat. Angelina Jolie makes me crazy for all kinds of reasons, the least of which is the way she thought she was helping the masses and her family by removing her breasts because of a "faulty gene" as she calls it. I would like to talk a bit about this faulty gene. You can consider this Breast Cancer: Part 3 if you want to.   Do you remember in 2013 when she had prophylactic double mastectomies after she tested positive for the BRCA gene? She also says that she did this because her mother died young (56) from cancer. <a title="Angelina Jolie Op Ed NYT" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/14/opinion/my-medical-choice.html?_r=0" target="_blank">http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/14/opinion/my-medical-choice.html?_r=0</a>

    BRCA1 and BRCA2 are human genes that produce tumor suppressing proteins which helps repair cells to keep a 'balance' if you will in the body. Remember that cancer are cells that have mutated or changed in a bad way and then they replicate out of control and overwhelm an organ, organs or the entire body. If you are tested and are positive for one of these genes, your chances of breast cancer are increased but it doesn't mean that you will automatically get breast cancer.    There are a few things that need clarifying though that her op ed piece and others in the news didn't really mention:</p>

    <ul>

    	<li>As my general surgeon and I discussed in 2010, I wasn't very interested in being tested. He agreed with me and made an interesting remark, "How many BRCAs are there? Does anyone know? And what if you test negative for 1 and 2? Maybe you are positive for BRCA3 which they haven't even discovered yet. What if there are 50 BRCAs? We just don't know."</li>

    	<li>Insurance may or may not pay. Obviously for Jolie, money wasn't an issue. But I would imagine that $3000 out of pocket as she was quoted as saying would be pretty substantial for many people.</li>

    	<li>Even if you are tested and it comes back positive, the testing cannot tell you if you will ever get cancer nor when. Sometimes the test comes back ambiguous. Do you feel better or worse after the tests tells you nothing?</li>

    	<li>If it comes back negative, a woman may breathe a sigh of relief but that does not mean that she won't get cancer. How many out there believe if it's negative, I'm home free? My guess? <strong>A lot!</strong></li>

    	<li>If you test positive, then what do you do? For many, they start getting more mammograms (see previous posts on that topic) or they start wondering if they should do what Angelina Jolie did and have them removed. I like what Dr. Susan Love said about it. She said, "when you have to cut off normal body parts to prevent a disease, that’s really pretty barbaric when you think about it.” Meaning we are so far off from understanding breast cancer and when  sometimes the best thing is to 'amputate'  it means we are just treading water, not swimming toward shore with an answer to this disease.</li>

    	<li>If you do not have one of the risk factors that would make you think about having this test, going ahead and having it done because Angelina did, well guess what? It has been shown to give false-positive test results, meaning it is saying you are at risk but you are really not!</li>

    	<li>According to a follow-up article in the health section after Jolie's article, <a title="Angelina Jolie follow-up NYT" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/15/health/angelina-jolies-disclosure-highlights-a-breast-cancer-dilemma.html?ref=opinion" target="_blank">http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/15/health/angelina-jolies-disclosure-highlights-a-breast-cancer-dilemma.html?ref=opinionMutations </a> BRCA1 and BRCA2 are estimated to cause only 5 percent to 10 percent of breast cancers in white women. No one knows how common or uncommon it is in other races.</li>

    	<li>Surgery, any surgery comes with its own risks. Anesthesia, the safest thing that is done in healthcare, still has its risks. No one should have any surgery done without a thorough knowledge of the risks, benefits and alternatives to the procedure being discussed.</li>

    	<li>Jolie was able to have a nipple sparing procedure. I don't think most women understand when you have cancer and they take your breasts, they do not leave your nipples behind as a souvenir. They are removed as well.</li>

    	<li>In her article, I think she minimized the postoperative phase stating that though she looked like someone from a science fiction movie with her drains, within a few days she was back to living life as normal. Do you know why? <strong>Because she didn't have cancer</strong>. It took me a lot longer and my future was more uncertain than hers. I didn't jump back into life. I jumped into chemo.</li>

    </ul>

    <p>I believe if a woman is genetically tested and finds that she is positive for these genes and she decides to have prophylactic mastectomies, it is within her right to do so. But at the same time I am so saddened and so angered by the women who have chosen this path somehow trying to emulate Angelina Jolie because she is  beautiful and oh so brave.  I have read articles where physicians have been repeatedly unsuccessful talking women out of this 'fad' (my term) thanks to this actress and it breaks my heart. No one should have this done to them, to their bodies, unless they really have no other option. Trust me.

    <h2>Chemo Comes Calling for the Third Time</h2>

    <p>I knew in my gut (no pun intended) that when I had the PET scan in October that the one in December would show further activity and that chemo would be my Christmas gift one more time. I am on some sort of cosmic two year cycle. But my oncologist caught me off guard Friday night when she called to talk to me and to ask me how I felt about going ahead and starting chemo the same week of the scan. I have felt this coming for a couple of months. Look at this odd timeline:</p>

    <ul>
    	<li>I was diagnosed in fall of 2010, started chemo #1 December 2010.</li>
    	<li>Then it spread in fall of 2012 and chemo #2 started in December 2012 (anyone else picking up on this little trend?)</li>
    	<li>And so, I just had my scan in fall of 2014 and guess what? Chemo #3 starts in, you guessed it, December 2014.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Well, at least I am consistent. This is what I know about the last tool in my oncologist's arsenal:

    This chemo called kadcyla (ado-trastuzumab emtansine),  is supposed to be a bear if it is taken on its own. Luckily it is tamed somewhat if you are taking a drug called trastuzumab which I have been on every third week since 2012.  (Aren't I the lucky one?)

    Kadcyla does not cause hair loss. I will be the judge of that since this would be the third time I would be going  bald and vain as it sounds, this was going to be the deciding factor whether I did chemo #3 or not. Wait a minute, do you think my beloved oncologist is lying to me? Nah, I don't think she has ever lied in her life.

    As I have called a few folks over the weekend to tell them, it has occurred to me that many people don't know that there are many kinds of chemo - that chemo is a generic term and is not the cancer drug that everyone takes no matter what the disease. Just a clarification for those that might think that as well. This will be the third different chemo that I will be receiving. As a chemo stops working, in metastatic disease, another chemo is tried. The goal is to keep the cancer at bay as long as possible. Curing it is not. So when one fails, you move on to another one. At some point, the arsenal is used up as in the case of Elizabeth Edwards.

    So, here we go. As they say, "This ain't my first rodeo.</p>

    <h2> A NC Angel</h2>

    <p>Well, I want to tell you about a real-life angel. She is someone I worked with back in North Carolina in the OR. Though we were colleagues and friendly with one another, we weren't buddies. Why, I don't know, looking back. But I remember her being exceedingly smart, very fit and I do believe she served in the Gulf war which seems so long ago now...but let me tell you about this angel in the flesh. I responded to a linkedin post back in the summer (prior to starting my blog) to a man who wrote a post about bucket lists. I commented on the post some of the things that I have blogged about here. And then the most amazing thing happened. This former colleague emailed me and said, "I think everyone should see Billy Joel once in their lifetime. I have two tickets to see him at Madison Square Garden and I would like to send them to you." I was dumbfounded. Not because she is not known for being kind - a great nurse but wholly cow! What an act of kindness! After a couple of emails, I thanked her profusely so guess where we are headed today?

    We are driving to Manhattan today. We will see Billy Joel tonight and on Wednesday, we will shop and marvel at the Christmas lights and shop windows (an annual favorite thing for me to do). Then we will drive Thanksgiving Day further down to Philly to have dinner with my beloved's family.

    Thank you my NC angel for giving me such a wonderful gift.</p>
