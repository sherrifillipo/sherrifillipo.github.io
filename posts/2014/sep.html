  <h2>Why Am I Doing This?</h2>
    <h3>September 15th, 2014</h3>

  <p>Today marks my first post. I didn't fully realize what an old dog I was until I started trying to learn about blogs. And now I have a whole new vocabulary with words like slugs, pings and pikes. Oh my. But what I really wanted to do was chronicle what's left of my life for those who care to come along with me. It's difficult having a career come to a grinding halt and then add a terminal disease on top of it. I have always been a writer at heart but now that I am coming upon my second anniversary of metastatic breast cancer, I feel if I am ever going to write, now is the time.</p>

  <h2>Breast Cancer and Seaglass</h2>
    <h3>September 16th, 2014</h3>

  <p>If you were to look through my recent employment history, you would see what appears to be some hiccups. Well, actually the hiccups turn out to be bilateral breast cancer which ground my full-time career to a screeching halt. And if you were to take a second look, just when I got back up and started down that patient safety career highway again, I stopped. Well, although I stopped, the breast cancer decided to take a journey and move on to my liver. So much for dusting myself off and moving on with life.

So, I now have a lot of time on my hands which allows me to do a lot of thinking...

  I just got back from my vacation on the outer banks of North Carolina where I sat and walked and looked for sea glass, my favorite hobby. As most anyone who has a serious illness will tell you, you spend a lot of time thinking and reflecting on life and death. And it dawned on me while walking last week, that cancer has made me a much kinder, gentler woman. It, like the ocean does to discarded glass, has made me softer, has buffed away my rougher edges. Many relationships have been mended since my diagnosis; many others have gone deeper due to time suddenly not being on my side. My family calls more often. I call more often. Though it has changed my life and those lives around me forever, it has made me thankful for the tumbling and tossing it has done to me - like the glass that fills my jars and my pockets.

  This is again why I wanted to start a blog and have you, if you are interested, follow me as your time and interest allow. In my mind it's a lot like when a group starts out on a walk down the beach together. Little by little, smaller groups form, some walk alone, some catch up to you and walk a while before stopping to pick up a shell or race ahead to someone else. I will be here walking along (at a pretty slow pace!) but join me as you want, when you can. </p>

  <h2>Words of Wisdom From My Hairstylist</h2>
  <h3>September 17th, 2014</h3>
  <!-- Currently having a problem with indentation starting with the 2nd paragraph -->
  <p>My hairstylist, whom I love and adore, has been with me on this cancer journey for two years. We had just gotten my once bald head to sport a blunt bobbed haircut - almost - when cancer struck again. We both cried when we looked in the mirror because we had come so, so close to getting me to look like my pre-cancer self. And then it was gone.

  It was Thanksgiving two years ago after the diagnosis that the cancer had spread,  when I told him to cut it all off. I could see the panic in his eyes, all our hard work literally down the drain. He asked me if I wouldn't consider waiting until after Thanksgiving so as not to shock the family, as it were. But I pushed him and indeed he cut my hair. He is young and dear and I wouldn't trade him for anyone else. And I know him pretty well at this point. He left for a few minutes talked to his mentor composed himself and came back, feeling more positive about the haircut.

  We both got a little teary as he went to work but at the end, he said, "You know what, Miss Sherri?" (Yes, that is what he calls me. I don't think I would let anyone else call me that.) We are just going to 'rock this new haircut' like we wanted it to be this way. NOT because we had to! I love his attitude. So we did.

  Later after Thanksgiving, we brought the clippers out and he shaved my head for chemo. He cried. I cried. We are both so tired of all of this.

  So, almost two years later, I went in yesterday for a color and cut. We have decided to keep it short. I mean really short. I think we are doing it for a couple of reasons. One, to ward away the evil spirits (just kidding) but also when the inevitable scan comes back with bad news, I am already sporting the short cut. That much less to shave in the end.

  I also told him today that I was starting a blog and his beautiful blue eyes widened in surprise!  I told him I know I am an old dog but he waved that off. What he told me was that I had to promise not to sugarcoat anything. That my readers needed to understand that this is in real time with potential real emotions coming out of this keyboard. He suggested I place a disclaimer at the top of the home page! I won't go that far but he made me stop and realize, this may not get pretty and making it pretty would do a disservice to those women who might read this and are struggling with breast cancer. He said you don't want to make it look easy because it's not. He is such a wise man to be so very young.</p>

  <h2>Bucket Lists: Mine and Yours</h2>
    <h3>September 18th, 2014</h3>

  <p>I think a lot about my bucket list.  It probably started after watching the movie <em>The Bucket List </em>starring Morgan Freeman and Jack Nicholson several years ago. At that time, I used the phrase loosely and kept those things in my head that I 'might want to do someday.'  Then when this whole cancer thing came crashing down, I got serious about it and started writing things down. I have a very generous husband who does not want to be mentioned in my blogs so don't mention it, but he has been wonderful in helping me check off some really big items and some very small ones.



  I would urge you to go ahead and make your own list. It would be a good exercise in helping you form what is really important for you to see, do, or accomplish and it also will help you prioritize where to place your time, energy, and money.



  <strong>So far, I have checked off the following items:</strong>

  <ul>

  	<li>Visiting Montreal and practicing my perfectly horrible French on some unsuspecting cab driver</li>

  	<li>Attend one more Eagles concert (although I keep trying to drag this one back on the list, my beloved vetoes it every time!)</li>

  	<li>Eat at the Anchor Bar in Buffalo, NY where they "invented" buffalo wings. Yes, they were delicious. My husband, stepdaughter and her boyfriend came along and we devoured 50!</li>

  	<li>Go to the Caribbean and just sit and look at the blue water. I have never seen such beautiful shades of blue, blue-green. And to our delight we found some seaglass there as well!</li>

  	<li>Go to the Sea Glass beach in northern California. It was amazing! You just walked on seaglass instead of sand. My mother who is seaglass challenged having never been able to find any on her own, asked me to bring her back a bucket of glass (she literally meant a bucket) and I was able to. She just had to sift through the sand and pebbles to find it.</li>

  </ul>

  <strong>What's next?</strong>

  <ul>

  	<li>Living here in upstate New York, I keep hearing about skating on ponds in the winter. Doesn't that sound so Currier and Ives romantic? I know someone special who lives on a BIG pond and she is ready to host me!</li>

  	<li>I want to go down the luge at Lake Placid. My biggest supporter of this trip is my brother-in-law. With his persuasive personality, I keep thinking we will be able to make this a family trip, nieces, nephews and all!</li>

  	<li>I want to see Frank Lloyd Wright's <em>Falling Water</em> home. This will be an easy one as it is just a few hours from my own home.</li>

  	<li>I am a real foodie at heart and want to go to the Culinary Institute of New York and have dinner there. Maybe stay overnight and eat several meals there!</li>

  	<li>And though rather clichéd, I would love to swim with a dolphin. I have loved dolphins since before it was cool, in high school I collected them in glass, wood, and porcelain.</li>

  </ul>

  I really went in depth to get you to start thinking about what you might like to start doing. My urging to you is to start today as we all know, our future is not guaranteed.</p>

  <h2>Bucket List Part 2: The Outrageous and the Letting Go</h2>
    <h3>September 19th, 2014</h3>

  <p>So, since yesterday's post, I have talked to family and friends and they want to know some of the things that I have let go of and  some of my outrageous bucket list items that if I could wave that magical wand, I would make happen. OK, so here goes. (What I am afraid of by doing this is that this list might show more of my strange internal wiring than is necessary!)



  <strong>Things that I have let go of:</strong>

  <ul>

  	<li>I am never going to learn French to the level that I once dreamed of (even with two great friends who are native speakers!)</li>

  	<li>The month of the metastatic diagnosis, I had just completed an application to Loyola for a master's degree in health law; I am so disappointed about letting that go that I still allow them to email me and query my continued interest. But clearly this degree won't happen.</li>

  	<li>Lynne, this is for you: although I pushed through six months of full-time black belt training and completed my project, I moved on from that role and never obtained certification; while I have been given another chance, it seems too daunting to finish that final lap.</li>

  	<li>I will never write a book. I have a quirky southern novel in my head but alas, it will have to remain there.</li>

  	<li>Attending culinary school</li>

  	<li>Being a grandmother</li>

  	<li>I can't go on as I will become too maudlin.</li>

  </ul>

  <strong>My outrageous, need a magic wand for these:</strong>

  <ul>

  	<li>I would love the Eagles to sing Hotel California to me (I told you these were wild) Heck, I 'd let them choose the song!</li>

  	<li>I would love to meet Michael Strahan (former Giants football player and co-host to Kelly Ripa) I am told my mother-in-law can never know this as she is a staunch Eagles fan so if you meet her, keep this under wraps. Why I want to meet him, I don't know. He just seems so likeable. I too, am an Eagles fan.</li>

  	<li>I live 10 minutes from where Tommy Hilfiger grew up and I keep thinking I am going to run into him and he is going to want me to model clothing for his middle age clients. Like he designs anything for middle aged people. Have you ever gone in and looked at the size of the shorts he sells? My linen napkins are larger.</li>

  	<li>I'd like to sing and dance with Jimmy Fallon. Yes, I know I can't sing but in my mind, he won't care! I can keep up with him on the dancing part.</li>

  	<li>I think dinner with Steve Martin would be a crazy good time!</li>

  	<li>I would like to sing back-up (they could turn the microphone off) at a concert of some kind. Anything from a 70's band. My useless knowledge of most all 70's songs is quite extensive. If you don't believe me, ask my in-laws.</li>

  	<li>I would like to be a guest bartender somewhere. I have been told I make a mean margarita and a mean G&amp;T; I have also been told I am a "long pour" and no one would let me tend bar.</li>

  </ul>

  OK, enough of this silliness. Maybe as you are at work on this Friday, you can add to your list and/or come to terms with those things that may need to be let go of so you can spend your time accomplishing what can!]]></content:encoded>

  <h2>My Nemesis NED</h2>
    <h3>September 22nd, 2014</h3>

  <p>Although I am not crazy about it, Ned goes everywhere I go. Funny, my husband sort of likes him. Ned lulls him into thinking everything is all right even though all three of us know it is not true. That is the way it often is with metastatic breast cancer. After the shock of the announcement that the cancer has found its way out of your breasts, after the second onslaught of chemo, the second time your husband shaves your head and afterward you put on all of those stupid hats again, it almost becomes routine.

  And then a few months later, your oncologist says with a bright, wide smile, “Your scans show no evidence of disease (NED)” and everyone waits for you to jump up and shout for joy. But you know what? You don’t because unless that proverbial bus creams you on the way to the grocery store one morning, you know how this book ends.

  You don’t know how many chapters are left in the book, true – but you do know who dies in the end. So Ned hops in the car with me as I go about my day and when I meet friends for dinner, one of them will invariably say, “You look so great! You really do! You simply don’t look like you have cancer!” I know she means that as a compliment but I cringe inside as Ned looks on smiling. You see, Ned is a deceiver. He knows that I am not ok, that no matter how much make-up I apply I still don’t have eyelashes. That no matter how good I look, my life is being cut short. I may have two years left, maybe. But Ned is silent – there, but always silent.

  On one of my recent treatment days, Ned was there when a nurse told me that thanks to my reconstruction, I now had the breasts of a nineteen year old! I know she meant it as a compliment to offset an otherwise dreadful situation but I wanted to smack her and Ned both. Though my breasts are indeed beautiful, my chest wall, not to mention my right arm is numb. Completely numb. My reconstruction is all for show. When I am in a foul mood, I say my breasts are useless. Ned knows this and doesn’t care.

  Though I can carry on polite conversation in almost any situation, despite my disease and treatment regimen, Ned is right behind me watching. Case in point – I am a nurse but can no longer work full-time. At a hospital function a few months ago, a pharmacist who didn’t know my background asked me what I did with all my time since I didn’t work. Ned grinned. I told her without any drama, well maybe a little for effect, that when I wasn’t volunteering at a local hospital, I was getting treatment for breast cancer. “Well, you look great!” Ah, yes. I do look great.



  To tell you the truth the only way I get through conversations like the above mentioned is the satisfaction in knowing that at some time in the not so distant future, when my cancer returns, Ned dies. And I will be rid of him forever. No more lingering around, sitting on my shoulder, going with me everywhere I go. I guess in a way I do get to have the last word when it comes to Ned. Though the irony of the situation when this occurs is  not lost on me.

  <h2>PET Scan Today</h2>
    <h3>September 23rd, 2014</h3>

  <p>Well, I have been rather crabby for the past two days prepping for my PET scan. Why? Well let me list the things for you that I have not been able to eat for a day and a half: potatoes, rice, bread, alcohol, juice, soft drinks, coffee, any sugar. Are you kidding me? Even though my beloved tried to pacify me with a nice juicy steak last night, which did taste really good, but  how good could it be when I had it with green beans and a glass of water!?!




Whine...whine. So, I got up this morning (without coffee) and drove through the lovely hills of upstate New York and checked in with Radiology. When I was taken back 'on the truck' and an IV started, the radioactive isotopes injected, I was told I needed to lie perfectly still for an hour and that I could not read anything, in any form! Wow! And he left.

So I lay there and wondered how long or how short would an hour be for me? And what should I do? Except move. So, I thought I should at least pray for a while. I had tried to have my devotional time before I headed out. I don't know about you but without two cups of black, strong coffee under my belt in the morning, the rapture could occur and I would be like, "Hey, where are we going? What just happened? I'm not awake yet." But I prayed - for many of you, for my son and then before I knew it, I had fallen asleep. Many of you are not surprised.

Then I was taken back and pushed and pulled through that CT doughnut of a machine. Those can be long minutes when you wish with all your might that you could know right then and there if they are seeing something - but you can't and you don't. You just lie there and listen to the worst music ever.

Afterward, he got me up, handed me some gluten free cookies (don't get me started on that) and out the door I went.

I drove back through the hills, clutching the first cup of coffee that I have had in 48 hours like it was gold. Now the hardest part, not the IV stick, not the claustrophobic CT machine but the wait.

So since I am radioactive until nightfall, I thought I would post this blog which is a lot of nothing (!) and wait for dinner filled with carbohydrates!

I will let you know in a few days the results of the scan...</p>

  <h2>Home Away From Home</h2>
  <h3>September 24th, 2014</h3>

  <p>My southern friends often ask me how I am faring "up there in the north." To many of my friends and family, they can't conceive of living above that ole Mason-Dixon line. They are worried that having cancer while living in foreign land must be more than I can bear. Sometimes, I really go for it and say, "Can you believe we live only three hours away from <em>Canada</em>?!" I try to make it sound as dramatic as possible. I am known for that.

  My southern friends and family heard me complain about a certain southern city I lived in when my cancer was first diagnosed, where the mastectomies occurred, where my first round of chemo occurred, where I fell on my icy deck and had the largest cerebral hematoma anyone had ever seen that didn't require a trip to the Operating Room. The same city that in the spring when all of this cancer tragedy had subsided, I walked out on the same deck and fell right through it - literally - bearing a nasty scar on my shin to this day. I remember screaming to my husband, "Get me out of this damn city! I can't stand it any longer!" And sure enough he did. Because he is that way.

  And before I knew it many months later, I jumped in my car and drove to Corning, New York. I didn't look once in the rearview mirror at that southern city I was leaving. Oh, the relief I felt that day, I cannot describe. For my southern folks, the picture above is downtown Corning. This is the little oasis that we found ourselves living in when six months into our new apartment, I was diagnosed with terminal cancer. I thought we had left cancer behind in the south. This was to be our fresh start. Yet, as Yogi Berra said, "It was deja vu all over again."

  But I am here to tell you, the experience  of having cancer this time was a totally different experience. You see, although only a resident of Corning for six months, I already felt like a member of the community. I was working at Corning Hospital (right across the street from where we lived at the time!) and already felt like a part of the hospital team. Because downtown is only about five blocks long, shopkeepers already knew me - I was supported in every way possible.

  I have never lived anywhere so small - my residences have included  Manhattan, Washington, DC, New Haven, CT, smaller but still larger than Corning places like Raleigh and Winston-Salem, NC. But never in a place where people driving by will call out your name and wave! When I walk up and down Market Street (that's the street in the picture) shopkeepers will wave to me from their stores! I know it sounds like the perfect place and it is in my mind. My stepdaughter came to visit last year, born and raised in Philadelphia, she turned to me and said, "This place is idyllic." Yes! That's the word I had been searching for.

  I love it here. My heart is here and I have encouraged all of my friends and family to come and visit. Every one that has driven or flown in to visit say the same thing, "This place is wonderful!" No surprise that Rand McNally gave it the title "Most Fun Small Town in America!"</P>

  <h2>The Results are In</h2>
    <h3>September 25th, 2014</h3>

  <p>The results of the PET scan are in and I have had a couple of conversations today with my oncologist, whom I adore. What I like most about her (besides the fact that she was a nurse and then went back to medical school) is that she is willing to listen to her right brain when she needs to. It was her right brain that told her two years ago that something wasn't right with me when there was nothing to indicate that there was anything wrong except that I continued to complain about fatigue. She talked me into CT scans and the rest, as they say, is history.

Today she told me that the PET scan shows that there are two lesions on my liver but because we don't have an old PET scan to compare it to, we do not know if they are old or new. But this is where her right brain kicks in that I appreciate. She said her gut tells her something is brewing, that the current medication I am on every three weeks isn't stopping these two lesions from being 'active.' So the plan is for me to add hormonal therapy to my regimen. It will hopefully take away the "fuel" aka estrogen that might be feeding these lesions.

And then another PET scan in 8-12 weeks. If the PET shows activity at that point, I along with my beloved who does not want to be talked about in this blog, will have to decide if I will go back on chemo. Until then, I will continue to ramble here in my blog.

Don't worry. I am fine. It is a beautiful day in Corning. I am sitting here doing the very non-southern thing and drinking a G&amp;T after Labor Day. You do know that you do not wear white pants nor drink G&amp;Ts after Labor Day, right?</p>

  <h2>My Homework</h2>
  <h3>September 25th, 2014</h3>

  <p>Everyone has said, "You are handling this much better than I ever would." They don't know that for sure. I believe everyone has a reservoir of strength that is waiting to be tapped for something - climbing a mountain, childbearing, surgery, any number of stressful situations I can think of. But I want to tell you a couple of months ago, I hit a real low. I had come in to the hospital for a meeting and someone in an office yelled out a greeting like they do in Corning, remember? And though I said hello back, I did not go in to the office and chat. Looking back, I am not sure why. And three hours or so later this person was dead. And I began to cry. A colleague to be sure but not someone I was particularly close to. But I cried. And cried.  Long after  my work friends who had known this person for years had stopped crying, I was still crying.

  Then a couple of weeks later, I was at a leadership meeting and a video was shown of our  hospital construction and I began to cry in the dark. What is wrong with me, I kept thinking. Afterward, when the room emptied,  two of my closest friends and confidants came over and I just wept. One of them said, "I think you need to see someone." And so I did.

  Everything is so close here in Corning which is why I love it. From dry cleaning to sushi, just step outside on Market Street and start walking. You will get there in no time. So I walked over to this large lovely home, now a counseling center and waited, wondering what I was going to say. "Isn't everyone with terminal cancer supposed to be teary?" she might think. The answer is no! I looked up and there she was. We walked upstairs to her office. Lovely office sitting up in the trees. She was so poised and quiet. So I told her my story of the sudden death of a co-worker and it dawned on me as things often do in a counseling office I suppose, that I came face-to-face with death that day and it extended to my own death. Duh.

  Her counsel was simple and powerful. This is what she said:

  <ul>

  	<li>Your body is slowing down, preparing itself for death currently through the forgetfulness, the instability in your gait…it will increase and change as you come nearer and nearer.</li>

  	<li>You’ve been pushing it and pushing it and your body is saying, “It is time to focus inward, and to settle yourself.”</li>

  	<li>Your body cannot and should not be trying to keep up with anyone who is healthy. You cannot do it and it is showing you that.</li>

  	<li>It is time to stop taking care of everyone, friends and family, trying to make sure everyone is ready for your death. It is time to focus inward on yourself and prepare for what is coming.</li>

  </ul>

  I walked out into the late afternoon back to the apartment with some kind of burden that had been sitting on me, lifted. No more crying like that. In the end, do you know what she told me? Start a blog.</p>

  <h2>Joan Lunden, Call Me</h2>
  <h3>September 26th, 2014</h3>

  <p>A friend asked me the other day if I would run out of things to write about! Are you kidding me? I will be long gone and will still have ideas sitting in my "draft" box that this website keeps for me. I promised my mother I would not do anything edgy before October breast cancer awareness month (ugh) but standing in line at Wegmans yesterday I knew there would be no holding back once I got home. You see, as I stood there in line, beautiful, bald Joan Lunden stared back at me on the cover of People magazine with the quote, "I will beat this!" It made me so angry I just had to look away. I wanted to speed dial her and set her straight. I imagined she would pick up the phone and I would say, "Joan. Listen, you have it all wrong. <strong>You</strong> don't get to decide if you will beat cancer - <strong>the cancer does</strong>." And then I would go on to educate her on cancer that stays in the breast versus cancer that leaves it and what a disservice it is to women and families who deal with the diagnosis of terminal breast cancer and how they might worry that they had not fought as hard as say, Joan Lunden and that's why they were dying. Oh, I've gone and gotten myself started!

  I will close to say or maybe it is a disclaimer: October is a rough month for women who are living and dying with metastatic breast cancer. I have so much I want to write about but will wait.

  The ribbon you see above is the ribbon for metastatic breast cancer. I think the colors are befitting.</p>

  <h2>Blog Update!</h2>
    <h3>September 28th, 2014</h3>

  <p>I received an email this afternoon that the Metastatic Breast Cancer Network wants to publish my "Joan Lunden" blog nationwide!  They loved the title,"Joan Lunden , Call Me" and it will come out soon.  I wonder what I will say when Joan calls...hmmm.....</p>

  <h2>A Mist That Vanishes</h2>
  <h3>September 30th, 2014</h3>

  <p>I have been in Manhattan since Saturday having the time of my life. One of my favorite cities, I am fortunate enough to live four hours away so an easy drive (well, until you get about 20 miles from the city and then you can imagine). My first trip to New York was when I was in high school. I fell in love instantly. I thought it was the most magical place on earth.  The hustle, the bustle, the fashion. I still wonder how women trek through the streets of Manhattan in stilettos.

We are here as my better half sits on a national advisory board of physicians, nurses, IT folks and so on who come together twice a year to discus patient safety issues. They have been kind enough to let me tag along for a couple of years. This is the group that I write articles for that pertain to patient engagement (for you in healthcare you will learn a lot  by logging on to <a title="Engaging Patients" href="http://engaingpatients.org/" target="_blank">engagingpatients.org.</a>)

I have to admit though that when the meetings are in session, sometimes I am acutely aware of my career being over as I am on the other side of the door. I also often feel this way when my husband comes home from work or a friend stops by for a drink and I want to know all about the things that are happening in the hospital and as you can imagine that's the last thing they want to talk about!

So, this morning while these folks are in session, I sat down in my window seat overlooking Wall Street and read my devotional. It never ceases to amaze me how on target some of these are. Today's verse out of the book of James is one of my favorites, "You are a mist that appears for a little while and then vanishes." While that might make some readers sad,  it actually gives me comfort. For you see, no matter how much I want to get out there and grab every last minute of New York (or the world for that matter) I am tired today. So, I am not. I am going to rest and wait until this evening to have dinner and then have conversation with those folks who are behind the closed doors. We are all mist. Knowing that I can't do everything, releases the stress from me allowing me to do some things.</p>
