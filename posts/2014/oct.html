  <h2>Melissa Versus Aretha</h2>
    <h3>October 1st, 2014</h3>

  <p>So a friend and a stranger (who is now a friend) read my bucket list blog, the one list that required a wand to make a dream happen and they decided to get me tickets to see Kelly Ripa, but more importantly Michael Strahan. Unbeknownst to me, they worked on it a couple of weeks. (Who knew it would be such an endeavor?) By the time I left for Manhattan last Saturday, they told me they had secured tickets and that I needed to confirm them via email. But by the time I arrived in my hotel and clicked on the "accept" button, the tickets had been given to someone else.
I was SO disappointed and continued to try and log on through the weekend as I was told tickets could open up at any minute. On Sunday, we went to one of my haunts which is a pizza place beside the Ed Sullivan Theater on Broadway which just happens to be where David Letterman tapes his shows. There was a young woman on the sidewalk who asked me if I wanted to get tickets to the show but I was so hungry I told here I'd be back after lunch!
When I went back to tell her that yes, I would like to see a taping, I was then told it was a lottery system. (Here we go again, I thought.) What the heck. I filled out the form and left.  A few hours later, I got a call that I had gotten a ticket and the next day I found myself sitting in the theater. I had googled who was going to be on the  show and was less than enthusiastic about the guests but what I really wanted to see were the behind the scenes action anyway.
I was seated beside a very interesting man who ended up telling me he was a hairstylist from Miami and by the way he said, "Your short haircut looks faaaabulous!" Little did he know, right Dustin? He then turned to me and said, "I heard that the guest was Aretha Franklin!" Well, that definitely wasn't on the list when I googled it.

And I am sure you know by now that she came out in an aqua ball gown with her own band and five back up singers and belted out "Rolling in the Deep" with a little "Aint No Mountain High Enough" thrown in for good measure!
Can I just tell you though I appreciate her contribution to music, I can't say as I was a fan. But the audience was electrified.  If you google " Aretha and David Letteman" you will see dozens of article and posts about that song. At the end, the audience jumped up and gave her a heart felt standing ovation. I was really overcome. I felt so fortunate to have been in that room yesterday.
This morning, I woke up and turned on Kelly and Michael to see who/what I was missing since this was the  morning that I was hopefully going to be there. Please no one take offense if you are a fan but the singer was Melissa Ethridge....hmmmm...I do believe when God closes the door, he can open up a big, wide window.  And through that window, I heard Aretha sing.</p>

  <h2>Joan Lunden Blog as posted on The Metastatic Breast Cancer Network</h2>
  <h3> October 1st, 2014</h3>

  <p>Joan Lunden, Give Me a Call
    I promised my mother I would not do anything edgy before October breast cancer awareness month (ugh), but standing in line at Wegmans yesterday I knew there would be no holding back once I got home.

    You see, as I stood there in line, beautiful, bald Joan Lunden stared back at me on the cover of People magazine with the quote, “I will beat this!” It made me so angry I just had to look away. I wanted to speed dial her and set her straight. I imagined she would pick up the phone and I would say,
    “Joan. Listen, you have it all wrong. You don’t get to decide if you will beat cancer – the cancer does.”
    And then I would go on to educate her on cancer that stays in the breast versus cancer that leaves it and what a disservice it is to women and families who deal with the diagnosis of terminal breast cancer and how they might worry that they had not fought as hard as say, Joan Lunden, and that’s why they were dying. Oh, I’ve gone and gotten myself started!
    October is a rough month for women who are living and dying with metastatic breast cancer. I have so much I want to write about! Stay tuned.</p>

  <h2>There Is An Elephant in the Room This Month and It’s Pink</h2>
    <h3> October 2nd, 2014</h3>

  <p>You know what month this is, right? How could you not with all of the bubblegum pink everywhere on everything. For many of us living with metastatic breast cancer, it is our least favorite time of year for a variety of reasons. But though the month of October is dedicated to breast cancer awareness month, October 13 is the one day dedicated to the disease that is actually killing us. Think about this statement:
    “No one dies from breast cancer that remains in the breast. Metastasis occurs when cancer cells travel to a vital organ and that is what threatens life.”
    I remember when I read that statement for the first time. It was like the proverbial light went on. Now I knew why I was always irritated when I saw women in pink tutus walking in those “we are survivors” breast cancer races. As well intentioned as both the women and the races are, many of those women who are so excited to call themselves “survivors” really aren’t survivors! Ouch. I know I step on toes by saying it but the truth of the matter is this, if the cancer doesn’t leave the breast, you don’t die from the disease. You get to die from something else. The statement from above is taken from an organization that I would bet many people have never heard of: The Metastatic Breast Cancer Network http://mbcn.org/  whose slogan is, “fighting for treatments to extend life.” Note that it does not say to survive breast cancer or to beat breast cancer because if you currently have metastatic breast disease the focus is on control of the disease and the quality of life that remains. Remember, we know how this cancer book ends. We know who dies in the end.

    Those of us, around 155,000 living with metastatic disease in the US, aren’t typically the ones in tutus racing through the streets of America. We are too tired, too sick, too tethered by IV tubing to our local hospitals to do much dancing. This is how you can help: To see women who are living and dying with metastatic breast disease as a very different patient population from the women who have experienced ductal carcinoma in situ breast disease (cancer inside the breast). After my double mastectomy, a nurse practitioner once told me, “Don’t ever let a woman who has had a simple lumpectomy tell you that she knows how you feel. Because she doesn’t.”
    Until I was diagnosed with metastatic disease, I did not know that only 2% of the annual cancer fund of $5 billion is slated for Stage IV cancers of which breast metastasis is a subset. It has taken me a while to appreciate the fact that the “pink ribbon breast disease” as I call it is the pretty disease. Metastatic disease is not. It is the ugly disease. We are the group of women who scare the ladies in pink tutus because we are dying from the disease that they are running scared from. We  are the women that are ignored by the pink ribbon organizations because we are living examples that you can do everything right and still die from breast cancer. We are the reminders that you can have your screening mammogram every year, without fail, just like I did, and still have invasive cancer diagnosed after your annual mammogram. We make other women uncomfortable. And I believe that is why so infinitesimal is the money given for metastatic disease research.
    Let me put it another way. Do we really need more money funded for breast cancer awareness campaigns? Who in heaven’s name is not aware of breast cancer? What we need is money funding the disease that is killing 44,000 of us in the US annually. Soon it will be me. Which is why I write and which is why I am asking you to come to grips with the two diseases. And acknowledge that one size does not fit all. You can do all the self-breast exams you want; you can get an annual screening mammogram; you can do everything in your power to thwart the disease but if it is going to get you, it is going to get you. Early diagnosis does not equal survival. Good girls are not the ones who get screened and don’t get breast cancer just as the bad girls are not the ones who get the screenings and still go on to get the disease.
    We need to shift our paradigms and take a stand that money be shifted as well to finding the cures for the disease. It’s too late for me but not for someone close to you. A future child? A future grandchild? October 13 is dedicated to those of us who won’t get out of this alive - National Metastatic Breast Disease Day.</p>

  <h2>The Source Of My Humor and Storytelling?</h2>
    <h3>October 3rd, 2014</h3>

  <p>I have been asked over the past few weeks where my humor comes from and how I learned to "story tell" as someone called my writing. Well, it may start with the picture that you see here. I am the younger girl in the photo and my sidekick is my aunt, Marie. All of eight years older than me. Old enough to be dating when I couldn't, young enough to take me to the local 7-11 and spend money on me for candy. And oh did we buy candy. My silver filled teeth can testify to that. I was really like the 5th child in line. My mom had me young and she being the oldest had three younger siblings and then came me. Marie being the fourth child,  I am closer in age to her than she is to my mom,  her sister - hence this relationship.
  Marie is funny. If you don't believe it, ask her to do her "wide-mouth frog" routine. Or her "wishy washy" routine. She was so cool. I would watch her go to football games in the late '60's while I hung back with her mother, my grandmother. I loved to  spend weekend nights with Nannie as I called her.  Though I hated Lawrence Welk, she kept poptarts in the cupboard for Marie and my Uncle Bill and when I was there I could have two if I wanted! Nirvana!
  I would often sleep in Marie's bed when I visited (when I wasn't in my Aunt Susan's bed - I would go back and forth) and if I could keep myself awake til midnight or whenever she came in, she would tell me the story about  Smokey the Bear fighting forest fires. I have NO idea where she got the idea for that one but over and over and over again I would ask her to tell me that story. And she complied every time without complaint.
  So maybe it was trying to emulate her through my formative years that laid the foundation for the humor and the writing. All I know is that she along with Aunt Susan are regular readers of this blog and for that, I am thankful.

  PS: Marie just texted me. Still very cool for a grandmother of four - and she said after she read this post, it reminded her of me coming home with them most Sundays after church. And the first thought I had was, "Oh shoot a monkey!" Which is another phrase she still says (no PETA people, we don't have monkeys in my home state of NC, nor did Marie and I go out hunting them.) Because then I had another memory of fried chicken every week. And because I was the youngest and oh so adorable (!) I got to choose which side of the "pully bone" to choose to make my wish come true. Aunt Marie and Uncle Bill occasionally got irritated that they didn't get to choose, but there are some advantages of being the first grand child. So, we would pull and pull until one of us had won. Oh they were good ole days.</p>

  <h2>Mammography: What I Bet You Didn’t Know</h2>
    <h3>October 6th, 2014</h3>

  <p>There has been a lot of controversy about mammograms in the past few years. Some heralding them as life savers, some wanting them to be done on younger and younger patients and so on. The woman you see here is probably familiar to you. Her name is Amy Robach and she used to be an anchor on NBC's Today Show. Then she moved over to Good Morning America. She recently had her first mammogram and they  found a mass. She is currently seeking treatment. She has stated publicly that the    mammogram saved her life. Hmm... Listen to what the renowned breast surgeon, Dr. Susan Love  http://www.dslrf.org/breastcancer/  author of the definitive book on breast cancer entitled,  Dr. Susan Love's Breast Book said in response:
  “Did the mammogram save her life, as one doctor was quoted as saying? The answer, of course, is we don’t know. While mammography is capable of finding about 26% of cancers at a point where it makes a life-saving difference in the outcome, it also finds many lesions which would never have gone on to be life-threatening and others which will still be life-threatening in spite of early detection and rigorous screening."
  "The problem is not the mammogram as a detection tool, but the natural history of the disease, which brings us to the crucial point…not all breast cancers are the same. Before a treatment is prescribed or chosen, it is critical that a woman or man knows what kind of breast cancer they have of the roughly 5-7 kinds we can now recognize. There are probably many more kinds that we just don’t know about or know how to recognize yet. The behavior of the cancer is dictated not as much by when it is found as by what kind it is and how that kind usually behaves. This information informs the decisions about treatment. …"
  "We all need to help tone down the hype that mammograms are the be-all/end-all life-saving tool and stop fueling mass fear that a questionable mammogram is a potential death sentence.”
  Dr. Loves' book is highly readable whether you have breast cancer or not. What I learned from her interview is that mammography is not as straightforward as the public believes.

  <h2>A Question From My Son</h2>
  <h3>October 7th, 2014</h3>

  <p>I have one child - a handsome 23 year old who is finishing up a degree to begin work as a paramedic. He is equally skilled in the kitchen. I think he will make a wonderful catch for someone but I digress. He lives in NC where he attends school so sadly our communication comes from texts, calls and visits every few months. It was last summer when he came to the beach house and after a swim, dinner and a soak in the hot tub, he walked into my bedroom. I was sitting on the side of the bed; he walked over, put his arms around me and said nothing for a long time. It was so good to be near him. I miss him terribly; for many reasons he and I were extremely close when he was growing up. The two years  I spent  homeschooling him, he recently told me were the two best years of his childhood. Wow.
  That night, he turned to me and asked, "What is it like living between two worlds -  one foot on earth and one foot in heaven?" If you know my son, you are not surprised at the depth of that kind of question. His preschool teacher used to call him her philosopher at the ripe old age of four. Another mentor called him his little theologian.
  I told him I hadn't thought of it that way but indeed that is exactly how I feel. I really don't sweat the small stuff anymore. I am freed by a lot of the things that you, the reader, are not. I no longer try to envision what living in a nursing home would be like. The stock market has no effect on me. I no longer wonder when I can retire. I no longer wonder what I will look like at 70, 80. I tell people I love them freely. I eat ice cream any time I want.
  I am much more focused on my movement toward heaven as time slips by and I am very cognizant of every day, of everything.  I experience things so acutely now. The leaves turning this fall have never been more beautiful. The river that runs through out town never lovelier. Every time my son calls, when he texts me that he loves me, I am overwhelmed with love for him, for others, for God. I am not sure how much time I have and yes I do feel like I am living in two worlds. I am at peace with that.</p>

  <h2>Women of Faith</h2>
    <h3>October 9th, 2014</h3>

  <p>I saw my oncologist today. She and I are  women of  faith. When we are alone, we discuss the human and spiritual dimensions of this disease and where it is taking me, my husband and my extended family. I am so thankful for her. She is young and wise and takes all the time I need when I am struggling. We have both been tearful together; we pray for each other. I am deeply blessed to have her overseeing my care.

  But when I say faith, I know that means different things to different people. I feel I owe it to you my family and friends to explain what I mean. Yes, I grew up in the south where some would say, it's easy for you to claim faith, as everyone 'down there' goes to church. I agree that many do go to church but as a minister once said, "walking into a church doesn't make you a Christian anymore than walking into a garage makes you a car." I heard that as a young person and thought it was funniest thing I had ever heard at the time.

  <strong>These are the things I believe:</strong>

  <ul>

  	<li>I believe there is a  God who orchestrated the heaven and earth. I am not hung up on evolution.</li>

  	<li>I believe the world has fallen into sin from the very beginning. I am not hung up on a real or an extended six-day creation.</li>

  	<li>I believe that for every sin, there must be a payment for that sin (if you hate that word, substitute 'wrongdoing').</li>

  	<li>Until God sent his son, Jesus, to be the ultimate payment for Sin (any and all and everyone's) there was a separation between God and man.</li>

  	<li>Christ came, lived and then died for our sins. Every last one of them. Which is why we no longer bring birds, bulls, calves to the altar.</li>

  	<li>I believe he arose after three days. I really, really do. An actual resurrection.</li>

  	<li>Christ is the bridge between God and man.</li>

  	<li>I believe that as the scripture says, that He has gone to make a place for me (for me!) in heaven. I can't wait to see what my room looks like in that mansion. I'm thinking a fireplace in my bedroom with a Siamese cat sleeping at the foot of my bed, just waiting on me. We'll see!</li>

  	<li>I do believe in an actual heaven and actual hell. No, I do not believe that everyone will go to heaven.</li>

  	<li>No, I do not believe that there are many ways to heaven through many different spiritual paths.</li>

  	<li>Going to heaven is easy. The only thing you have to do is accept that you are a sinner (To me that is easy as I have done SO much wrong in my life) and that you need to be forgiven for your sins. I don't know  about you but I would rather trust/acknowledge that Jesus is my payment rather than the herd of cattle I would have to bring to the altar way back in the day. And then through prayer, ask Him to be your savior.</li>

  	<li>When I pray, I am praying to the author of the universe and I believe that He is listening.</li>

  	<li>Does this confession and acceptance as Christ as savior make your life easier? No.</li>

  	<li>Does this protect you from all harm and disease? Again, a big No.</li>

  	<li>Will believing help you get through all of the disease, disappointment, disillusion of the world? A big yes.</li>

  	<li>Is it ever too late to become a believer? Absolutely not.</li>

  	<li>Are there any sins too horrific to be forgiven for? No.</li>

  </ul>

  I feel better just letting you know where I stand. He is what gets me through the days. He is who I cry out to. He is who gives me spiritual comforting that weaves with the human comforting I get from my husband, my friends and my family. In this day and age of diversity and doing your own thing, I know it all seems square. I  get it - assurance of salvation.</p>

  <h2>The End is Near</h2>
  <h3>October 10th, 2014</h3>

  <p>This past weekend the town of Corning hosted its annual marathon wine glass festival. Above you see the sweet faces of my two stepdaughters. One was running and the other injured, is just coming along side her sister at the finish line. They are great young women who have welcomed me into their family with much grace. I love to have them come and visit. The one on the right is the one from several posts back who  labeled the town of Corning, "idyllic."  And I must add one boyfriend who joins in as well. They are three dynamite people and when I sit and have a glass of wine with them, I feel I am young again. They laugh at the stupid things I say. We talk about everything and they tolerate my belting out '70's hits on the radio when we go exploring up in the finger lakes wine region which we always seem to do.

  They have been so, so patient with me through this blog adventure and especially through the month of October. When something I find obnoxious comes on the television at night, I don't even have to ask their permission to mute the screen. They know I cannot take very much during this month.

  While their dad, my husband who does not want to be mentioned, the boyfriend and I drank mimosas Sunday morning while we waited on Heather (right) to finish. We noticed a woman near the finish line that held out a bright orangish sign that simply read, "The end is near." It caught me as hilariously  funny as a non-runner and knowing that my own end is near (I didn't need a middle-aged woman holding a sign to remind me!) But she stood there for at least 45 minutes to the point that the dear boyfriend, who is a phenomenal photographer I might add, slipped outside to take her photograph holding the sign. Come to find out in the running world, wacky signs toward the finish line are not uncommon. I just found it ironic and hilarious that she chose outside my restaurant window to remind me of something I already know!</p>

  <h2>My Golden Girls</h2>
  <h3>October 14th, 2014</h3>

  <p>
    I am off this weekend to see two childhood chums. Between the three of us, we have <strong>not</strong> had a lot of down time. Between the three of us we have 92 years of marriage logged under our belts six college/advanced degrees, each of us has one child a piece. That to me has always been  interesting to note. One came by surprise, one by adoption and one through perseverance.  We wouldn't trade them. We grew up in the 60's when lunch was 30 cents, where we spent a lot of time outdoors and a lot of time talking about boys.

    One friend I met in the first grade. She was THE popular girl with long wavy black hair. She was the 'girlfriend' of the most handsome six year old I could imagine back then. (We didn't know Donny Osmond at that point.) She took dance lessons of which I coveted and later as a young adult had to ask forgiveness for as I had buried that covertness in my heart for a lot of years. The only dancing I did was when I took the trash out or when Soul Train came on Saturday afternoons. I remember in the second grade while learning mythology (why were we learning mythology when the Viet Nam war was going on? I still don't know). She was chosen as Helen of Troy (I should have known). I was back-up Aphrodite. "Oh" but the teacher said, "She is the goddess of love and beauty!" Like I didn't know that I was still second fiddle. But my friend was never one to taunt her first grade fame. She is and has always been modest.

    The other friend, I met in the fourth grade at the water fountain. She came careening around the corner and stopped. She looked at me and said,  Don't you just hate it when your slip hangs out beneath your dress?" I thought, "Who are you,  and I am not sure I even own a slip!" And she has been my friend ever since and continues to pull at her slip.

    I love them. We survived being bussed across town back and forth every two years. And though our closeness has waxed and waned as all long term friendships do, breast cancer for two of the three of us has cemented our middle years together.  I love them both. We are three very different people but we share a common southern background that no one can take from us. Sadly, we  recently came together for one of our mother's funerals. It was a mix of happy and sad. We hadn't all been in the same room in 15 years? I  am just guessing.

    I am a firm believer in the saying that new friends are like silver, the old ones gold. They are my 'golden girls.'</p>

    <h2>Sabrina Has Left the Building</h2>
    <h3>October 15th, 2014</h3>

    <p>When I return for my next infusion at the Cancer Center,  my nurse of two years will not be there. For two years, she and I have had a date every third week for the better part of a morning (or afternoon). I met her two Thanksgivings ago when it was time to start chemo again. I remember staring out a window, teary-eyed and in disbelief when Sabrina walked into my cubicle. I turned around to meet her and when she saw me weepy, she hugged me right off the bat. Little did I know that Sabrina does not do that very often. I don't think that she realized at that moment that she was staring into the eyes of someone with newly diagnosed metastatic disease and when I reminded her, her eyes conveyed a more knowing and sympathetic look. My second port of which she got the privilege of accessing was far more tender and so swollen as compared to my first one that I didn't think I would make it through that morning but I did. Thanks to her wicked sense of humor and her tenacity.

    In Virginia, I was used to lying down to have chemo and here, there is only one bed and many recliners. Although she didn't fully understand why I was so attached to that one bed, she made sure that if it was within her power, she would have that bed ready for me. A true patient advocate. And seeing someone every third week, one gets to know someone very quickly. And she and I became fast friends both as women but also as nurses.  She said one of the toughest things she has done in her career is break the shell of my better half but like I say, her wit and her zaniness, even he couldn't resist. We became a trio.

    When I went through my rough patch after my colleague died (written about several posts ago) I cried a lot that day during my infusion. It was tough on her I think because I have been pretty upbeat throughout these past two years but that day she was stressed because I was stressed and I continued to think what a great and empathetic nurse she was.

    But as in life, all good things must come to an end. She once told me she didn't look forward to my demise as we have become so close. And then she told me last month that she had accepted an offer in another healthcare organization. I told her based on my last PET scan, she was getting out just in time. Our humor is that way. I will really miss her and am getting all choked up as I write. But I know she reads this blog - she affectionately calls it stalking me. So, Sabrina, thank you for taking such good care of me - for meeting all my needs. Thank you for not holding back the <em>candy</em> when I needed it. I will miss you dearly.</p>

    <h2>Metastatic Breast Cancer Alliance: October 2014 Executive Summary</h2>
    <h3>October 16th, 2014</h3>

    <p>Today's post comes from the  Metastatic Breast Cancer Alliance <a title="Metatstatic Breast Cancer Alliance" href="http://www.mbcalliance.org" target="_blank">www.mbcalliance.org </a>October 2014 Executive Summary entitled, <em>Changing the Landscape for People Living with Metastatic Breast Cancer.  </em>I know some of what you will read, I have mentioned in previous posts but this is so important. Thank you for indulging me during the month of October:

    "A greater understanding of what MBC is and how it differs from early stage breast cancer is needed among patients, their families and healthcare providers, researchers, and the public.

    <ul>

    	<li>The focus on "fighting" and "beating" breast cancer has led to the creation and dominance of a breast cancer "survivor" which masks the reality that women who have had early stage breast cancer can develop metastatic disease.</li>

    	<li>The focus on screening and survivorship can stigmatize patients who experience a recurrence or are diagnosed at stage IV - they may be perceived to be at fault for the cancer's progression.</li>

    	<li>The effects of public and professional misconceptions or lack of understanding about metastatic breast cancer  can negatively influence decisions made by patients and their doctors regarding treatment and quality of life.</li>

    	<li>More can be done to build the understanding of  healthcare providers about how to discuss treatments and quality of life, including palliation of their patients."</li>

    </ul>

    <strong>This quote resonates with me so much:</strong>

    <p>“We did nothing wrong. Our medical team did nothing wrong. Metastatic breast cancer happens...at any time...regardless of your age, whether you did chemo[therapy], radiation, had a mastectomy, had a bilateral mastectomy, ate well, took vitamins, exercised regularly, prayed, had positive thoughts, had negative thoughts, got regular mammograms, did self- exams religiously, had a tiny stage 1 primary tumor, or a stage 0 primary tumor, or a stage 3 primary tumor, or never even had primary breast cancer. <strong>It doesn’t matter</strong>.” —MBCN website (emphasis mine).</p>

    <h2>Now, Meet My Silver Girls</h2>
    <h3>October 17th, 2014</h3>

    <p>Lest you think from my "golden girls" post that those two are the only ones I care about, you would be wrong. I want to introduce you to my two <em>silver</em> <em>girls</em>. These two I have been friends with for all of five years. I met them both when I lived in Connecticut. I hold them dear to my heart. They are both physicians which impresses the socks right off of me. Women who were able to navigate medical school back when it wasn't shall we say so 'diverse'? I marvel at their intellect. But they are also a boatload of fun.

    The first friend is an epidemiologist and I got to know her when I worked at Yale-New Haven Hospital. She and I co-led the hospital hand hygiene initiative which sounds like a real yawn unless you had sat through our presentation/lecture. By the time we had taught around 300 people, we had our song and dance down pat and the audience loved us, if I do say so myself! If being a physician isn't impressive enough, she is also from French descent and speaks it fluently. She is an avid runner and has a physique that I will never have. And she loves a good strong margarita. Yes, she sounds almost perfect!

    My other friend, also a physician, is the Director of Patient Safety at the hospital association where I also worked. She has a keen mind for details and can coordinate huge programs to accommodate members from all 28 hospitals across the state. She always has a kind word and has a way of navigating through difficult work situations with aplomb. She is elegant and thoughtful. The best part about her? She, too, loves a good margarita!

    I feel like I am the luckiest girl in CT when we three get together. Over the last year, I had been driving back into New Haven to volunteer at Yale about once a month. To be frank, I was not ready to leave Connecticut when we did but that's life. I believe it also symbolizes "health" to me as I was diagnosed almost immediately after moving from CT to Virginia.  So, I go back. I walk the shore across the street from my former home on the Long Island sound. I collect seaglass as I walk. I drive down and  get harassed at the local Italian restaurant by two of the long time bartenders. If you let them harass you long enough, they will pour you a glass of wine on the house, so why wouldn't I just sit there and take it for a few minutes? And then I go out with my two silver girls.

    We have gone to different places but the one that I think we all three lean toward is an upscale Mexican restaurant near the hospital. (If you are ever there, it is Geronimo, their website is: <a title="Geronimo" href="http://geronimobarandgrill.com" target="_blank"><em>geronimobarandgrill.com</em></a> ) They serve the best margaritas and some of the best Mexican food I have ever eaten. We typically get a high top table  near the bar, and order the guacamole made tableside and along with the margaritas and talking to those two, I think I am in heaven. In fact, if heaven were like that, I would be perfectly happy.

    Since I am at Yale just about 48 hours when I go, we can get together once. So we end up talking at rapid fire speed to get in all that we need to get in before I leave. These two are precious to me because although I didn't grow up with them, they cared for me long distance during the dark days of surgery and chemo in Virginia. They sent cards, cookies, emails. One of them decided I needed some spring in my long dark winter here in NY during my second series of chemo and sent me a half dozen jewel-toned scarves to wrap up in. They are too good to me.

    So the three of us are figuring out how to get together. I am having more difficulty making the 10 hour round trip to Connecticut. I think they may be coming to upstate New York  before the holidays. I can hardly wait. Though there are no restaurants to compare to Geronimo here, I am known for being able to make a mean margarita!</p>

    <h2>My Yaya's: Somewhere Between the Golden Girls and the Silver Girls</h2>
    <h3>October 21st, 2014</h3>

    <p>One last group of women that need to be brought forward and recognized are my ya-ya's. Who? Do you remember the 2002 movie starring Sandra Bullock called The <em>Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood</em>? I bet many of you do. Well, at Cone Hospital there were five of us in perioperative leadership that constituted the ya-yas. One was the director of the Operating Room. She had been working in the OR  many years prior to my arrival and she was the one responsible for giving me a weekend option position when I had my son, allowing me to work Saturday and Sunday nights and therefore I was home Monday - Friday to care for Jim.  And for that I will always be grateful. She was fun and happy and when she led a meeting that she  felt was getting out of hand she had a hallmark saying.  She would open up her arms and pull her hands toward her chest and repeat, "Come on people. Come on back to me." It worked every time. I even do that now in meetings and think of her each time!

    The second ya-ya was the Director of the Recovery Room, known as the PACU to us. She is small and feisty like my mother and I often told her she looked like my mom as well. She was the one if there was some disaster brewing in the hospital, all you needed to do was page her and add "911" to the call-back message and she came to the rescue. When we would all drive together somewhere, she was the one screaming for us to slow down when anyone else was driving and if she was driving, she was a big believer in no left turns (she made that concept popular before UPS did!)

    The third director was tall, thin and impeccably dressed in Talbots, head to toe. She had the unfortunate job of being at the hospital at 5:00am or before as she was the director of  the pre-operative department. (Someone had to get everyone ready prior to a 7:30am OR start, right? Well, her team did it.) By the time I arrived to work some days, she had already worked a half day and was ready for lunch! This ya-ya had a quiet disposition but if any surgeon tried to ruffle her feathers, she could take him down in an instant. Some surgeons went months trying to ignore her in the department. She considered that a victory!

    The last ya-ya was my partner. While I was the clinical specialist in the OR, she was the specialist in the pre-operative and post-operative phases of surgery. Together we educated, oriented, taught courses, updated standards, wiped the tears of many an orientee and  we were the support team that backed up the three directors mentioned above. I call her "Country Mouse" and she calls me "City Mouse." Do you remember that children's story? Well, to this day she will email me or text me and start with: "Mouse".......

    Five of us. People told us in the hospital that we ran in a pack - five long, white lab coats flapping in the wind as we would put out one fire here, another fire there.

    At lunch time, one of the ya-ya's always paged the other four and we would meet in someone's office and off we would go to the cafeteria together. I guess we did run in a pack, didn't we? We weathered marriages, divorces, children, grandchildren, illnesses, diseases. As the world in that large five hospital system changed and swirled around us, we were "tighter than ticks" as they say down south.

    I was the one who broke up the group when I left and moved to Connecticut. When I then moved to Virginia, and was diagnosed so quickly, they packed up a car and drove to spend the weekend with me. We had a ball - laughing and reminiscing. One of the ya-ya's bought a pair of stilettos while there (she was always sporting 4" heels) and I bought a mink stole at a vintage shop. That night at dinner I put on the heels and the mink and sat on my back porch with them while we had cocktails. Nothing was too dumb to do around those women. We had been through personal and professional hardships and there were  no fronts to keep up.

    God is funny. The new person who took my position so reminded me of myself 20 years prior, it was amazing. Passionate about the OR, long ponytail swinging when she walked, even staff in the OR told her, "You sure do remind me of Sherri." She says it pleases her. It certainly pleases me.</p>

    <h2>One Out of Eight Will Get Breast Cancer: What I Bet You Didn't Know</h2>
    <h3>October 22nd, 2014</h3>

    <p>Again I quote from Dr. Susan Love's website on the explanation of the "one in eight" statistic that is quoted often and everywhere. See if it doesn't make you think differently after reading this:


    Dr. Love states:

    "The one-in-eight statistic doesn't accurately reflect the average woman's breast cancer risk. Age is the most important risk factor for breast cancer. That means the older a woman is, the greater her risk of developing the disease. Statistics from the US National Cancer Institute show that a woman's chance of being diagnosed with breast cancer by age is:

    <div id="navcontainer" class="carrot2">

    <ul id="navlist2">

    	<li><span class="expandTextL">From age 30 to age 39:     0.43 percent      (often expressed as  1 in 233)</span></li>

    	<li><span class="expandTextL">From age 40 to age 49:     1.45 percent       (often expressed as  1 in 69) </span></li>

    	<li><span class="expandTextL">From age 50 to age 59:     2.38 percent      (often expressed as  1 in 42)</span></li>

    	<li><span class="expandTextL">From age 60 to age 69:      3.45 percent      (often expressed as  1 in 29)</span></li>

    	<li><span class="expandTextL"><strong>Ever</strong> . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .<strong>1</strong> <strong>in</strong> <strong>8</strong> (emphasis mine)</span></li>

    </ul>

    </div>

    <strong><span class="main"><em>Ever</em>  is lifetime risk. This means a woman has a one-in-eight chance of getting breast cancer after the age of 70 </span></strong><span class="main">(emphasis mine).</span>

    These probabilities are averages for the whole population. An individual woman’s breast cancer risk may be higher or lower, depending on a number of factors, including her family history, reproductive history, race/ethnicity, and other factors that are not yet fully understood. "

  <h2>Boston Globe: Expand conversation to include metastatic breast cancer</h2>
  <h3>October 23rd, 2014</h3>

  <p>Anne Morris who is the chief executive officer of Susan G. Komen Massachusetts wrote a powerful article in the <em>Boston Globe</em> today of which I have taken an excerpt. Some days I have hope that metastatic breast disease will get the coverage it needs. Today is one of those days.

  <blockquote><!-- inside story_update.jpt --><!-- end article-text --><!-- Story tools --><!-- position:Bottom --><!-- uuid: aff92c60-5881-11e4-8cbb-6f10485da42a -->According to a recent survey, it’s clear that societal awareness of metastatic breast cancer shows a lack of understanding, and highlights the need to move beyond the current conversation. In fact, <strong>63 percent of Bay Staters surveyed know little or nothing about metastatic breast cancer, while 70 percent think advanced breast cancer is curable. Additionally, 47 percent think cancer progresses because the patient either didn’t get the right treatments or didn’t take the right preventative measures </strong>(emphasis mine).

  Given all this, it’s no wonder those living with metastatic breast cancer can feel excluded from the larger dialogue and emotionally unsupported. This lack of understanding on the part of the general public excludes these women, and their stories, from the daily dialogue.

  Women in Massachusetts and from all across the nation are at risk due to this huge communication gap when it comes to metastatic breast cancer. Helping those living with this dreadful disease feel like part of the conversation is an urgent matter.

  Metastatic breast cancer isn’t curable. In fact, the average survival time following a metastatic breast cancer diagnosis is approximately three years, and even lower among certain ethnicities. It remains the second leading cause of cancer deaths among women today.

  According to a study published in the journal The Oncologist, roughly one in three — nearly 30 percent — of women diagnosed with early breast cancer will eventually be diagnosed with metastatic breast cancer.

  Those of us who know someone diagnosed with breast cancer, even if it’s not advanced, need to heed the call to expand our knowledge of the disease and to understand the profound emotional toll that patients go through. These patients have different needs and different struggles than those diagnosed with early stage breast cancer."</blockquote>]</p>

  <h2>Dr. Susan Love's Take on the "October Pink Tsunami"</h2>
  <h3>October 24th, 2014</h3>

  <p>
  I read Dr. Love's blog<a title="Dr. Love's Blog" href="http://blog.dslrf.org/" target="_blank"> http://blog.dslrf.org/</a> today and thought that her words were powerful.  This is just a portion of  the blog:

  <blockquote> In addition, many companies agree that supporting breast cancer research and awareness is good politics and good business. Sometimes these well-meaning efforts, such as the recent pink drilling bits for the cure, can appear misguided, but that does not mean that the people who donated the money had nefarious motives or that the money will not be well spent.

  As we all compete for the public’s attention and dollars, we sometimes forget that this is not a race with just one winner; it is a team sport. There are many ways we can save the lives of women and men with breast cancer, whether it be by helping them get diagnosed and appropriately treated, or by focusing on research into possible causes, be they environmental, lifestyle, or genetic. There is no lack of areas that need money and serious study. For example, we don’t even know the anatomy of the ducts in the breast or exactly how breast cancer starts!

  <strong>When the NFL is wearing pink, it’s pretty clear that, collectively, we have achieved awareness </strong>(emphasis mine). We need all the organizations with their different perspectives to focus on their missions while joining in a collaborative effort to find the cause and ways to prevent breast cancer. Because the end goal, a future without breast cancer, is one we all can agree on."</blockquote>]</p>

  <h2>Dancing to Different Music</h2>

  <p>Over the weekend I read an article in <em>USA Today <a title="With fewer choices left, cancer patient turns to mom" href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/10/24/breast-cancer-patient-turns-to-mom-as-days-wane/17843777/" target="_blank">With fewer choices left, cancer patient turns to mom</a></em><a title="With fewer choices left, cancer patient turns to mom" href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/10/24/breast-cancer-patient-turns-to-mom-as-days-wane/17843777/" target="_blank"> </a>and realized it was about the young woman I highlighted a couple of posts ago - the  video post of the beautiful young woman who had gone to Paris and been professionally photographed. In that video, she was also interviewed and discussed her diagnosis of Stage IV breast cancer. This video is about a year old. The article I read showed a very different person. The woman in the article, the same woman in the pink chiffon dress in the video, is in a very different place now. There were few things I noticed:

  <ul>

  	<li>Jill told her oncologist that she was losing strength and did not want to continue her chemo. Her oncologist "listened" but then suggested that there were other chemo regimes that they could try.</li>

  	<li>Jill listened and then had to say to her oncologist, "What if I said I'm just done with chemo altogether?"</li>

  	<li>Jill and her husband are not in agreement with her desire to stop treatment. She says in the article, it is their only source of "contention" as she calls it.</li>

  	<li>I was surprised when she said in this article that, "it finally hit me that I am going to die of cancer..."</li>

  	<li>Her mother lives out of town but is planning to move in with Jill at the end. Her mother stated she did not want to move too soon so as not to alarm Jill in thinking that she has "lost all hope."</li>

  </ul>

  In reading the article, it made me feel sad. As close as Jill, her husband and her mother are, when each of them speaks, everyone is hearing something different. And when you add her oncologist into the mix, it becomes four very caring people, all on a different page.  They seem to be dancing around the obvious and I understand it. I really do.</p>

  <h2>My Periwinkle Palace</h2>
  <h3>October 28th, 2014</h3>

  <p></a>



  We bought our beach house on the outer banks of NC two years ago and for some unknown reason, I named it my "periwinkle palace." It is periwinkle colored but it is not a palace, except to me. Our refuge. We try and get there about once a month with an extended stay in the summer and at Christmas. The outer banks as most of you know is abbreviated as OBX. And for some, Christmas is abbreviated XMAS. Am I the only one who thinks this would be a neat license plate:  <strong>OBXMAS</strong>. No one in my family, or extended family (and you know who you are) thinks it's very clever. Well, I do.  I am hoping I get this license plate for Xmas but I doubt I will. At any rate, by the time the tiny yellow butterflies start to flutter on the beach, it is September and a reminder that we will get "our" beach back soon. We always say to ourselves, "go home and put the kids back in school...give us back our beach!" Snobby I know but really that's how the locals feel and we count ourselves as such. Heck, we get the "local's rate" on food depending on the restaurant and the day of the week. Bet you didn't know there was such a thing!

  I have a favorite bartender, yes I know, I really have many but this one is my most favorite because he and I have had many a serious talk while I have  had dinner and/or a drink at his bar. When I am alone during the week down there, I jump in my golf cart (!) and drive across the street to eat with him - my buddy. He calls our beach area, "the island of misfits" which is true and adorable. All you have to do is go and visit in November or December and take a look around. The folks look interesting and disinterested all at the same time. I love to go in the winter where we can all sit at the bar and the tables behind us are all empty! "Just us locals," I like to think. It's cold and windy and dark and the drinks flow freely. No kids, no sunburns, everything is slow and wonderful there that time of year.

  I am especially looking forward to Christmas this year. The week before Christmas my sister/brother-in-law are coming with 2,3,4 nieces/nephews (the number is fluid). And  my parents will come Christmas day bearing food from their Christmas Eve soirée. (My nieces and nephews all believe that "Mama Jane's" potato salad rocks.) December 26, the (step) kids come - I hate that word 'step' but anyway....... and it will be a house packed with movies, laughter, card games (my niece is a wicked game player - if she wants to challenge you to a game - any game -  run away and say no!)

  So much fun. I am so blessed. And I don't take a minute of it for granted.</p>

  <h2>METAvivor: Listen to What These Wise Women Have to Say</h2>
    <h3>October 29th, 2014</h3>

  <p>From the METAvivor website:  METAvivor is dedicated to the specific fight of women and men living with stage 4 metastatic breast cancer. At the time of METAvivor’s founding, no organization was dedicated to funding research for the disease and no patient groups were speaking out about the dearth of stage 4 cancer research.  While more and more people have taken up the cry for more stage IV research, METAvivor remains the sole US organization dedicated to awarding annual stage IV breast cancer research.

  <h2>Up in the Trees</h2>
  <h3>October 30th, 2014</h3>

  <p>They are forecasting snow on Saturday. No, I am not kidding. Not much, but enough to keep me inside, tucked away in my treetop apartment on the third floor. (If you are ever in town, we live above the Bass Outlet and the local yarn shop.) In my little corner of the family room, I am surrounded by large floor to ceiling windows - four of them that make up our back wall. Brick between them, we look out on large trees that I haven't been able to identify - thin fernlike leaves which turn yellow very late in the summer (like the end of August, first of September) and then flutter and twirl as the wind comes through the two mountain tiers between which we live. From my window now as I type, I can see the Chemung river (really very shallow but lovely and meandering. When I go for treatment tomorrow, it rides along beside me all the way to hospital some 45 miles away.)

And I can see the high school. It's all so sweet. In the morning, the fog lays heavily in town and I can often hear the band practicing and wonder how they can practice their marching if they can't see their hands in front of their faces. But since I am warm and cozy in my bed at that hour (!) I just roll over and wish them luck.

We are so fortunate to have a roof top terrace  that for a very brief period of time in the spring and summer, I can go out and read and tend my very small garden. Our cats, most folks know these two guys, Simon and Johnny, will push their overweight selves out there and spend it lolling about alongside me. The three of us don't get much done anymore.

By the end of the day we have worked our way over to wait by the door for "the one who does not want to be mentioned in this blog" to get home from work, so we can have some fun. It has taken me a long time to feel ok about not getting a whole lot done on any given day. But I am ok with it. I don't fight it. I just go along with it. I'm like a cat in a shoebox - perfectly at peace watching the world go by.</p>

  <h2>One Last Word to End Pink October Month</h2>
  <h3>October 31st, 2014</h3>

    <p>Two things as we finally end this month of pink. If you haven't viewed the metavivor video from a couple of days ago, would you do it for me as a favor? It is such an important topic. And if you can, would you pass the video on to your friends and family? There is so much misinformation out there and this short video to me sums it up so nicely.

Secondly, the quote below was at the end of one of my blogs. But it is probably the second most important thing I posted in the month of October following the video from above. So I am going to use it one more time.

“We did nothing wrong. Our medical team did nothing wrong. Metastatic breast cancer happens...at any time...regardless of your age, whether you did chemo[therapy], radiation, had a mastectomy, had a bilateral mastectomy, ate well, took vitamins, exercised regularly, prayed, had positive thoughts, had negative thoughts, got regular mammograms, did self- exams religiously, had a tiny stage 1 primary tumor, or a stage 0 primary tumor, or a stage 3 primary tumor, or never even had primary breast cancer. <strong>It doesn’t matter</strong>.” —MBCN website (emphasis mine).</p>
