    <h2>Time</h2>
    <h3>July 1st, 2015</h3>

    <p>I had the best time shopping for my son last week, choosing things that I wouldn't select for myself but thought would be just perfect for a young man's first apartment. I know maybe he should choose his own things but I admit I also had an ulterior motive though it didn't dawn on me until a couple of days later. I realized after I had fixed up his place and then found myself at Whole Foods looking for some strange toothpaste that he had asked for, did I realize I was trying to fill a lifetime of giving into a few days. You see, I won't be here when he turns 30 or 40. I won't witness his marriage nor the birth of any grandchildren. For those of you who do not know me, he is my only child (though I have three awesome stepchildren who have given me great joy but no marriages or babies but I digress!!)



    And off and on last week, I would find myself weeping in shopping center parking lots or on the way to his apartment, the concept of time being so acute to me. Did you know he does not read this blog? Never has? My prayer will be that one day he will. I have tried to gently ask him why he doesn't. For the past two years he claimed school gave him more reading than he could keep up with. I let that excuse go....now with school behind him he doesn't have that excuse but I have decided to let it lie fallow. This blog with all its rambling and drivel will be here for his perusal long after I am gone.



    I have also been keeping a written journal for him of a more intimate nature. He likes for me to tell him stories of when he was a baby or a toddler. So I have conjured up every story I could think of and have been writing them down over the past couple of years. I have shown him the cover of the notebook so he will know what to look for. For those of you who are in my shoes, maybe that is something you might want to do too?</p>

    <h2>The End: How to Talk about Dying by Ellen Goodman, The New York Times</h2>
    <h3>July 2nd, 2015</h3>

    <p>I know I am known as the Dr. Kevorkian of bloggers but I am dedicated to getting as many people as possible to have death and dying conversations. Ellen Goodman writes a powerful article about the death of both her father and then later her mother. I hope it sparks more conversations.



    **************************************************************



    I was 25 when I flew home for my father’s last birthday. His cancer had returned and he would die three months later at the age of 57. What I remember most about that weekend was the large rectangular gift box he opened. My mother had bought him a new suitcase.

    I don’t know if that suitcase qualifies my family for the Denial Hall of Fame. There are so many contenders for that honor. But I’ve carried the psychic baggage over the years. I have never forgotten that image and how we lost a chance to say goodbye. I still wonder if my father was lonely in the silence that surrounded our inability to talk about what we all knew.

    Decades later my mother began a long slow decline. By then, I was a newspaper columnist, a job that I often described as “telling people what you think.” I was professionally outspoken. But little had changed since my father’s death.

    Yes, my mother and I talked about everything — but we didn’t talk about how she wanted to live toward the end. The closest we ever came to discussing her wishes was when she would see someone in dire straits and say, “If I’m ever like that, pull the plug.” But most of the time there is no plug to pull.

    Gradually and painfully, my mother lost what the doctors call “executive function,” as if she were a C.E.O. fumbling with Excel spreadsheets, not a 92-year-old who couldn’t turn on the television or make a phone call. Eventually, she couldn’t decide what she wanted for lunch, let alone for medical care.

    In some recess of my mind, I still assumed that death came in the way we used to think of as “natural.” I thought that doctors were the ones who would tell us what needed to be done. I was strangely unprepared, blindsided by the cascading number of decisions that fell to me in her last years.

    I had to say no to one procedure and yes to another, no to the bone marrow test, yes and yes again to antibiotics. How often I wished I could hear her voice in my ear telling me what she wanted. And what she didn’t want.

    When my mother died from heart failure and dementia, I began to talk with others. It was extraordinary. Everyone seemed to have a piercing memory of a good death or a hard death. Some of these stories had been kept below the surface for decades, and yet were as deep and vivid as if they’d just happened.

    Too many people we love had not died in the way they would choose. Too many survivors were left feeling depressed, guilty, uncertain whether they’d done the right thing.

    The difference between a good death and a hard death often seemed to hinge essentially on whether someone’s wishes were expressed and respected. Whether they’d had a conversation about how they wanted to live toward the end.

    So, a small group of us — each with his or her own story — started the Conversation Project, a nonprofit, out of the belief that surely we could make this easier. Our partners at the Institute for Healthcare Improvement gathered experts frustrated at the pace of change who believed that the health care system wouldn’t change until the culture changed. So we are trying to change the culture.

    There is now, finally, a real momentum for improving end-of-life care. The signs range from the Institute of Medicine’s report, “Dying in America,” to the success of Atul Gawande’s book “Being Mortal.”

    There is also a growing public awareness of the need to break through the reluctance that has kept us tongue-tied for so long. A survey we did last year showed that 90 percent of Americans now think it’s important to have the conversation. But the same survey showed something else: Only 30 percent of us have actually had these conversations. So the gap remains huge.

    We still need to transform the cultural norm from not talking about how we want to live at the end of life to talking about it. The real work to close the gap is not just for doctors and patients. It’s for mothers and daughters, husbands and wives, families and friends. We have to bring people to the kitchen table to talk with those they love to have the conversation. And to do this before there is a crisis. Not in the I.C.U.

    In our survey, the primary reason people gave for not talking to their loved ones was “It’s too soon.” But it’s always too soon … until it’s too late. Half of all elderly people in hospitals cannot make decisions for themselves at the end of life. Far too many health care providers are uncomfortable and untrained in these conversations.

    From all the stories shared with us, we know that what people need most is help getting started. They need a travel guide to take the first steps down an unfamiliar and difficult road. So we created a Conversation Starter Kit, which deliberately avoids being a technical medical checklist for the dying in favor of a careful discussion guide for the living.

    Our starter kit asks what matters to you, not what’s the matter with you. It asks what’s most important to you in the last phase of your life? Who do you want to make decisions for you? Where do you want to be? Do you worry that you won’t get enough care? Do you worry that you’ll get overly aggressive care?

    About two-thirds of the nearly 300,000 people who have come to our website download the starter kit, which is free. We’ve been told repeatedly that conversations that had loomed as frightening and overwhelming repeatedly turned into the most intimate and rewarding moments.

    Is it important to have the health care system ready to respect and record our wishes, to have health care providers become more comfortable beginning these talks? Of course. But the hard truth is that we have to begin ourselves — by thinking about our own values, by sharing them, by bringing our own beliefs into the center of the room when decisions will be made.

    In my own adulthood, the culture of birth changed. It wasn’t doctors who first tossed out the stirrups and ushered in fathers and video cameras and “birthing rooms.” It was parents who said, birth is not just a medical experience, it’s a human experience. Now we are finally saying that dying, too, is not just a medical experience, it is also a deeply human experience.

    Last winter we held a national dinner party to break bread and taboos, to eat comfort food and talk about dying. I shared the table with Nancy Frates, who is known for starting the A.L.S. ice bucket challenge to honor her son Pete. “Now I understand,” she told me. “The conversation is a gift to your family.”

    When I helped found the Conversation Project, I thought we were doing this for people who were dying. I thought of my parents. I thought of “executive function” and “baggage.” What I have learned is that the conversation is also a legacy. This is the gift, maybe the last gift, we can give one another.

    Ellen Goodman, formerly a syndicated columnist for The Boston Globe, is a founder of the Conversation Project.</p>

    <h2>Lil</h2>
    <h3>July 3rd, 2015</h3>

    <p>During my several days of nesting on behalf of my son last week, I found myself in the grocery store looking for frozen collard greens (no I am not kidding, the child eats crazily healthy - anything and everything mixed into his brown rice).</p>

    As I was pushing my cart through the shampoo aisle, the loveliest woman came up to me and remarked on the sandals I was wearing. I love them too. They are handmade and a bit odd looking but feel like butter when you put them on. I told her all about them and as often happens in the south, we moved on to other topics. I told her she was so lovely that she should do those Dove soap commercials. She blushed. She told me she was 85 and I nearly fell on top of a display. The woman is an absolute beauty. Why didn't I take a selfie with her so you could see? Because I am an old baby boomer and things like that don't pop into my mind.

    She then told me she had lost her husband to cancer a couple of years ago and of course I had to brief her on my  own saga. That's what happens in Harris Teeter grocery stores in the south. You just park your cart and start talking to strangers. After a few minutes more, she hugged me. I gave her my web address so she could start following me on the blog. Yes, this sprite of a woman uses the computer. Then we parted ways.

    Ten minutes later, I was literally standing in the frozen vegetable aisle, when I saw her running toward me. She was carrying a bouquet of flowers. Out of breath she said, "For you. They are paid for. I wanted you to have something beautiful!" And off she went. Not until I went to check out, did the cashier remark, "Did you see the card?" I had not.</p>

    <h2>Breast Cancer and Bras</h2>
    <h3>July 6th, 2015</h3>

    <p><blockquote> Finding a bra that fits is tough. Finding a bra that fits when you've had a double mastectomy at 28 can be nearly impossible.

    Popular lingerie stores specialize in the latest shapes and colors but tend to fall short when it comes to suitable options for those who have had mastectomies due to breast cancer. Dana Donofree was one such woman, finding herself with few options as a cancer survivor in her late twenties.

    So she started <a href="http://www.anaono.com/">AnaOno Intimates,</a> a line of lingerie designed for women who've had surgery related to a breast cancer diagnosis but still want something that can make them feel beautiful.

    <h2>Alex, Liz, Matt, and Will</h2>
    <h3>July 8th, 2015</h3>
    <p>I have had the most wonderful gift come back to me after many years of thinking it was gone forever. Let me explain.

    I was on Facebook the other day (still new and mysterious to me) and found an article and video on a family that I knew  when I lived in NC. This is the family I think about when I think I have it bad and am wallowing in a pool of self-pity. Then I think about them and offer up a  prayer for Alex, Liz, Matt and Will.

    I met them at our community pool one afternoon (well, Alex and the two boys). Alex is 6' 7" or so I don't know but is <em>a tall drink of water</em> as the old folks say in the south. He had left the boys to play in the pool while he participated in a pick-up game of basketball adjacent to the pool. Because my son, Jim, and Matt and Will (twins) are the same age, they  played together and at snack time/rest period, I took the boys back to our area.

    Later Alex came up and thanked me, we struck up a conversation and then parted ways. I want to say it was the same weekend that we went out for Vietnamese and ran in to Liz and Alex.  I was able to meet this striking tall, thin woman with amazing black hair and a smile that would go on forever. We ended up eating together and a friendship of sorts emerged.

    As Paul Harvey used to say, "Now for the rest of the story." Liz was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis (MS) soon after the boys were born and then by the time they were oneish, they were diagnosed with muscular dystrophy (MD). I know. This triple whammy has kept me puzzled and praying to God about them for years.

    When I met them, they were all walking. Now Liz is in a wheelchair and is unable to speak. The boys, now 24 years of age, are both in wheelchairs and are having issues that go along with such a disease. Alex? Home full-time, full of energy and charm and laughter. No, I am not kidding and no, it is not fake or forced.

    When I worked in NC, the hospital was all of a couple of blocks from their home. So once a week, at lunch, I would scoot down the road and sit with Liz and read books to her. We plowed through the Mitford series and every now and then Liz would request something particular and we would read it. It was my goal to get her laughing at some character because to watch her crinkle her eyes and laugh and the way she banged on her hand on her leg when I had nailed someone's accent, made my day. It really did. Every now and then, she would ask me to read the same section over again and when she did, I KNEW I had done a good job.

    On an occasion, one of the boys would quietly wheel up behind me and listen a couple of minutes. And then they would motor away.

    Fast forward to 2007 and I told her I was moving. She was getting weaker and I was leaving the state and sadly one day we closed the book for good. Or so I thought.

    Last week I found Matt and Will's Facebook page and ask to friend them. The next morning, Alex emailed back, having read a little of my own saga, and asked if I would be willing to spend some of my time reading to Liz again. I was so happy. I asked him to make sure she wanted to and the next day he responded that she did.

    We are in the throes of figuring out Skype so I can sit in NY and read to her. I cannot tell you how happy this makes me to come full circle and be with this family again. Below is a video of them. A documentary is being filmed of this extraordinary family. Please watch it for me. You will not be the same afterward. The hope is that the film will draw attention to and assist with both MS and MD research.</p>

    <h2>Who Needs Angie's List When You Have Momma Jane?</h2>
    <h3>July 9th, 2015</h3>

    <p>I checked in with Momma last evening. I wanted to see how she was spending her first week out of school. I imagined she and Dad were probably on the back porch sipping on a drink and watching for the deer that come through the yard at dusk. Well, I would be wrong.

    Mom picked up the phone sounding winded and said, "Hello?" I asked her what she was doing; she sounded out of breath. She told me she had just climbed down off a ladder to answer the phone. "What?" At seven o'clock I thought? She went on to tell me she and Dad had decided they needed to paint the inside of the garage. Well, I think Mom thought it was a good idea and poor Dad went along for the ride.

    By the time he got on the phone, he said they were on their ninth gallon of paint! He sounded worn out. Mom got back on the phone and began to tell me all the virtues of this new ladder they had bought. I began to glaze over as I would rather be shot than listen to anyone talk about tools or ladders or do-it-yourself home improvements! As much as I love the red door of Talbots, I hate Home Depot orange.

    We talked a few minutes more and then she reminded me that they now had a BB gun ready to take out Frank. Don't be alarmed. Frank is the squirrel who has eaten his way through roughly a ton of bird seed this summer. He is so confident in his charm that he waves to Mom and Dad when he comes up into the yard. Mom is worried that her aim with a BB gun isn't going to get job done and thinks she needs something a little bigger. I just let her talk and then told her I would check in tomorrow. I don't think Frank has anything to worry about.</p>

    <h2>RIP Frank</h2>
    <h3>July 10th, 2015</h3>
    <p>You will not believe this. Yesterday, after I wrote  about Mom and Frank, I picked up the phone to check-in with her and before I could dial her number, received a text from her that said, "Frank met his own demise." And a picture of what look like ole Frank swinging from the bird feeder. I thought Mom must have read the blog though she would have to have been sitting on top of the computer when I hit the publish button, her response was that quick.

    So I dialed Mom. "Have you read the blog already?"

    "No, honey I have been up on the ladder."

    "Well, then why are you sending me a picture of Frank? I just wrote about him."

    "You did? Well, your dad and I came in and sat down to eat lunch and I looked up and said, Jim, Frank is at it again."

    Dad looked out the window, turned to Mom and responded, "Jane, have you noticed Frank is not moving?"

    Sure enough, Frank had eaten so much that he had fallen into the crook of the metal ornamental post that was holding one of the bird feeders and couldn't escape. He literally died being squeezed by "V" shape of the bird feeder post.

    I blew the photo up so I could see it and..well, poor Frank. Gluttony got him before a BB could.  I was going to share the photo but suddenly felt so sorry for him, I couldn't bear it and if you know me, you know I am no fan of squirrels but bless his heart...RIP Frank.</p>

    <h2>Time to Make a Call</h2>
    <h3>July 14th, 2015</h3>
    <p>After eleven hours in the car, I landed back in my  beloved, Corning, around 5:30pm last evening. I can't tell you how happy I was to see those hills/mountains and to be greeted stubbornly by my two senior citizen cats.  The temp was a mild.  I opened up the door to the terrace and looked at six weeks of a wild hippy growth of flowers. They looked perfectly content to have been  left to their own devices!

    What I learned in my six plus weeks at the OBX was that I am much less able to walk long distances than I thought. I believe it took a trip there with completely different surroundings to make some things clear to me. And sadly, my nausea increased with such force that I had to call my oncologist and have a talk with her about medications.

    Long story short, I am happy, happy, happy to be home. And yet Beloved and I had a conversation over the last couple of days and  decided it was time to call in hospice care <em>for medication management</em>. No, I am not signing off! I, too, am learning about the services of hospice and that you can call them well before you "need" them in the traditional way we grew up talking about them.

    But I will confess, though I need to call them today, I hesitate. It reminds me of when I turned 40. I thought, as I lay in bed, if my feet didn't touch the ground, I was still 39. I mean, after all, when I went to bed, I was 39 so if I just stay there, I won't have to enter that dreaded middle-aged span of time. Oh, little wise one. If I had only known then what I know now. I would have jumped up, landing both feet squarely on the ground and shouted for joy at being alive (and healthy).

    Wish me courage as I call today.</p>

    <h2>I Made the Call: Here's What I learned</h2>
    <h3>July 15th, 2015</h3>
    <p>Well, I made the call. Actually it was a call to my oncologist as I didn't know if I could make a self-referral to hospice or not. Apparently you can in New York but you need a physician's letter of eligibility...at any rate, I am seeing my physician in a couple of weeks - a multipurpose visit. I will get a tumor marker drawn for no better reason than the nurse in me is curious about its rise. But it will also allow me to flush and lock my port as I need to do every couple of months and then most importantly, my oncologist will be able to make the official referral.

So this morning, I began to google <em>hospice care</em> and novice that I am, I found all kinds of services before I realized I needed to be more specific in my search criteria. After three failed attempts (I found Manhattan, then Buffalo, then finally my little neck of the woods). I have not copied the entire section on patients' questions but just reading these parts I have copied below helped me focus and fully accept that this is indeed our next step. The information that especially resonated with me I have <span style="color: #008080;">highlighted</span>:

<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.sherrifillipo.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/flowers.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-2509" src="http://www.sherrifillipo.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/flowers.jpg" alt="flowers" width="600" height="518" /></a></p>

<strong>Q: What is Hospice? </strong><strong>A:</strong> Hospice is a special kind of care designed to provide sensitivity and support for people in the final phase of a serious illness. Hospice care <span style="color: #008080;">allows patients to carry on an alert, pain-free life and to manage other symptoms so that their days may be spent with dignity and quality at home</span> or in a home-like setting.

<strong>Q: What services are offered? </strong><strong>A:</strong> Hospice care involves much more than emotional support and hand holding. Although we hold a lot of hands and hug a lot of people, our service involves complete medical care. Our physicians, nurses, medical social workers, spiritual care counselors and volunteers contribute to a highly specialized interdisciplinary team. We work closely with patients' physicians. <span style="color: #008080;">We specialize in pain and symptom management for the patient as well as counseling for the complete family. Our staff is trained and experienced in meeting the special needs of families experiencing the crisis of caring for a loved one who is seriously ill.</span>

<strong>Q: Is Hospice the same as home health care?</strong> <strong>A:</strong> No. Both home health care and Hospice provide care for people in poor health, but only Hospice provides specialized and comprehensive care, including professionals who can provide medical, emotional, spiritual and practical support. <span style="color: #008080;">Hospice also provides full coverage for equipment and medications needed in the home. Available 24 hours a day</span>, our nurses support the family through any medical concern.

<strong><strong>Q: When is the best time to begin Hospice care?</strong> <strong>A:</strong> </strong>If you have been diagnosed with a serious illness, it’s time to find out about CareFirst services so that you can have all the information you need to make informed decisions about your care. <span style="color: #008080;">It is never too early to get this information</span>, and receiving this information does not make you obligated in any way to elect our services. You can ask your physician about hospice care or call us directly at ------or 1.800.------.

<strong>Q: Shouldn’t I wait until I am sicker to call Hospice? What if I am admitted to Hospice now, and can’t be re-admitted later?</strong> <strong>A: </strong>As long as your doctor certifies that you are medically eligible, you can be admitted to hospice care. <span style="color: #008080;">You can continue to receive this care as long as you are medically eligible, even very long term.</span> If your condition does stabilize or improve, and you are no longer medically eligible for care, you may have to leave Hospice services, but <span style="color: #008080;">you can be readmitted when and if your condition begins to decline</span>. Let a hospice admissions nurse help you with this determination, as some situations vary depending on your insurance coverage. Even if you are not eligible for Hospice care, CareFirst has many other services, including our Thrive program that offer Palliative Care, that may meet your needs.

<strong>Q: Just because I am admitted to the care of hospice, does this mean I am giving up?</strong> <strong>A:</strong> No. <span style="color: #008080;">Hospice is a means to help you live more fully</span> and comfortably, even at the end of life. As a matter of fact, many studies show that Hospice care – if started as early as possible – actually increases life expectancy, decreases hospital use, decreases symptoms of all types, increases quality of life for patient and families and saves money.

<strong>Q: What happens once a referral is made?</strong>  <strong>A:</strong> Once a referral has been made, an appointment will be set up to visit you at your convenience to discuss services offered by CareFirst. <span style="color: #008080;">If you want hospice care and your doctor confirms its appropriateness, services can begin the very same day.</span> If you wish to take time to consider the information presented, another visit can be arranged.

<strong>Q: What about payment?</strong> <strong>A:</strong> Most health insurances, including Medicare and Medicaid, have hospice coverage. No one is denied care due to an inability to pay. Care for patients without insurance or with limited insurance is paid for privately and can be based on a sliding fee scale. CareFirst also raises funds to help offset costs of the underinsured.</p>

    <h2>Wednesday Afternoon in Corning</h2>
    <h3>July 16th, 2015</h3>
    <p>I had one of my best days ever yesterday. This is the (ironic) beauty of cancer. My dear hairstylist has Wednesday off and as do I. Well, to tell the truth I am off every day of the week but that's another story. I was feeling a little fragile after writing the hospice blog and he, bless his heart has had a long term relationship end. So, what to do? We decided to meet at 3:30 and have champagne for no other reason than that we love Corning, we are alive, and we can. So, there!

    I live all of two blocks from him and had stuffed a bottle and two glasses into my pocketbook and tried to walk nonchalantly down the sidewalk to get to my destination. When, what do I see half a block down the road but a dozen little school children yelling, "Bake sale! Bake sale!" Oh, no. I had a hard and fast rule in my home when I was raising my son and that was if we ever walked by or drove by anyone with a stand selling lemonade etc, we would stop and buy something. This delighted my son for years as we would go out of our way to make crazy u-turns if we found ourselves on the wrong side of the street.

    <p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.sherrifillipo.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/bake-sale.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-2845 size-full" src="http://www.sherrifillipo.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/bake-sale.jpg" alt="bake sale" width="500" height="333" /></a></p>

    But guess what I had done? I had emptied everything out of my bag to fit my champagne and glasses in there. How studpid do you think I looked and felt when I had to turn to the outspoken leader and tell him, I didn't have a wallet in my purse. He looked at me incredously and smacked his head with both hands like, "Lady? Why are you carrying a purse with no money in it?" All the kids gathered around  me and it was all I could do not to shake the bottle really good and give them their first champagne shower (let the kids explain it to their parents) but I am not into wasting perfectly good, cold champage so I just shrugged my shoulders and acted like some dumb old lady who was out without all her marbles. That wasn't much of a stretch.

    So the afternoon drifted by. We talked and sipped and played with his two pups. At the end, we decided that he could use a little more mothering (e.g. to learn some basic recipes etc) and I could use a son who was nearer by (I need to cook for someone.) So, all in all a lovely cool afternoon in Corning. I asked the Lord a while back how I could be used with my limited resources and he has put together a perfectly lovely puzzle - reading to  my long lost friend, <a href="http://www.sherrifillipo.com/2015/07/08/alex-liz-matt-and-will/">Liz,</a> and cooking for and teaching my beloved hairstylist, <a href="http://www.sherrifillipo.com/2014/09/17/words-of-wisdo…my-hairstylist/">Dustin</a> to cook. Stay tuned.</p>
