    <h2>Gone to Carolina</h2>
    <h3>February 2nd, 2015</h3>

    <p>Wow. On Friday I flew to Raleigh, NC to visit Mom and Dad, then sidekick Aunt  and cousin Anne showed up on Saturday morning we five jumped into Dad's BIG truck (Daddy said it was like driving four Miss Daisies)  and off we went to South Carolina to celebrate my great uncle's 90th birthday!   His son and family flew in from Colorado, folks from everywhere including a dear friend of his from church all landed at a restaurant, about 28 of us in all. My uncle is still quite dapper at 90 and still has a mischievous gleam in his eye.  He is the cutie pie on the left although take a look at the photo. They are both adorable don't you think?   I think if we had been contemporaries we could have gotten in a lot of trouble together!

    Because it is <em>Momma Monday</em> and I am still here in Raleigh, although I wrote this last night, she woke up this morning wanting to edit my blog (I told her to get her own blog but she quickly reminded me that my audience wanted to hear more from her!) My uncle served in WWII on the <em>USS Hornet</em> in the South Pacific. And though a handsome young buck, my mother says he carried a "little tiny picture" of her during his entire deployment. Think Shirley Temple.

    He calls me Sherri Lynn and though it is indeed my middle name, no one and I mean no one has ever called me that except him. And to be frank, I don't think I would let anyone else call me that! He has been a widower for many years, still lives on a golf course and see friends regularly. And every few weeks, he will call. I can never remember the area code but as soon as I say hello, he will say, "Sherri Lynn? This is your Uncle Howard." And we gibber jabber for about a half hour.

    At the party Saturday, night, my cousin had made a family favorite cake, mocha, that my great grandmother used to make! (I think it must have been exotic back in the day, don't you?) And my mom had a red, white and blue, sheet cake made with the above picture of him with his Navy buddy smiling broadly at the camera both with their lives ahead of them. You should have seen him smile when he saw that picture. Though it took him a while, he came up with the name of his WWII buddy. We 'googled' him but to no one's surprise he was no longer with us.

    The private dining room held another party of about the same size. We couldn't tell what the occasion was as there were no balloons, nothing to denote anything special though they seemed to be happy to be there. When it was time to have our cake and to sing Happy Birthday, we went over to their section, interrupted their dinner and asked if they would join us in a song to our uncle. They more than obliged and I bet 50+ people belted out the song. Uncle Howard stood there hardly able to take it all in. When Mom showed the other party  the 'military cake' everyone clapped and an older gentleman in the back stood up, saluted my uncle and said, "Thank you for your service sir." It was absolutely magical.

    Momma is sitting behind me as  I write. She says I put too many 'ands' in my writing and if I were in the third grade and living in NC and it was time to take the standardized test and it was time to take it today, I would fail. Good thing for many reasons I don't live in NC and can choose if and when I come to visit.

    &nbsp;

    Addendum: Besides my affinity for too many ands, she just asked me if I knew to place two spaces after a sentence...............................</p>

  <h2>Miscellaneous Ramblings from North Carolina</h2>
  <h3>February 3rd, 2015</h3>
  <p>Today is my last day in NC.  Mom and I have binge-watched <em>Mad Men</em> while I have been here. I wanted to get her 'addicted' to it as she was to <em>Breaking Bad</em>.  I think I have succeeded.  She now has me obsessed with making sure I double space after a sentence.  If you notice I have not been doing it, please forgive me and look the other way...remember when I told you we have many similarities?  Well, as I have walked around her house the past two days, I keep shaking my head. Like my apartment, she has bird nests everywhere. I forgot she finds them as fascinating as I do. I mean real nests, not from a store.  I had to convince Beloved a couple of years ago that we wouldn't get any bird borne diseases. So, far so good - unless they cause breast cancer and in that case no wonder I got a double dose.  Ha. I don't think I like double spacing.

  When I read Friday's blog to my mom, aunt and cousin - the one about wabi-sabi, I had just started reading when my mom piped up, "Oh! Wabi-sabi. I have that on my  Pintrest account." Of course you do, I thought and kept reading but my aunt and cousin kept saying, "Wabi who?  I though that was the hot green stuff you put on sushi..." But Momma kept saying, "Oh no! It's all about the beauty in the world....life cycles...beauty in the wear and tear of life......." Of course she knew all about it. Why would I be surprised?

  After her backseat editing from yesterday's blog I invited her to be a "user" which in the blog world could give her writing/editorial rights to my blog. I told her Mondays could be hers and hers alone to write about whatever her heart desired.  No, she wouldn't take me up on that. Not sure why as she did a splendid job of sitting behind me today and being my 3rd grade writing teacher!

  We have had a good time. She is a good sport about so many things. Nothing gets her too upset - well some things do but I will restrain myself from revealing them lest I get her started. On a final note, I have been asking to have a hedgehog for a pet. Really. I think they are the cutest things in the world. They are quite prolific in my sister-in-law's country of Belgium. I want her to bring one back. I was happy to discover that Mom didn't know how cute and popular they are. She really didn't believe it until she had confirmed it with Pintrest! </p>

    <h2>Hidden Magic Everywhere</h2>
    <h3>February 4th, 2015</h3>
    <p>What a day I had yesterday, my last day in NC and then an evening flight back to 9 degrees and 10 inches of snow on the ground. I am convinced as I continue to look around that there are amazing things all around me (us) in the most unsuspected places. I wish I had learned that sooner in life. Last night I was on the shuttle bus in Philly going from one of the large terminals to Terminal F where all the small commuter planes fly out of taking us to small places further north and into towns tucked in the hills of NY, PA and beyond. I was sitting on the bus when an elderly woman sat down beside me. She noticed I was playing <em>Words with Friends</em> and asked me what that game was. When I told her, she said she would have to look that one up. She then started really talking. (And mind you this is at most a 5-10 ride across the tarmac). Come to find out, she worked for the Census Bureau for many years and somehow was in charge of listing/keeping track of the streets in the United States. A large and commanding woman she looked down at me over her glasses and said, "Would you live on Psycho Place?" I thought, "No, not if I want to keep flying I wouldn't." Yes, she said that it exists out in Arizona I think she told me. "How about Toxic Waste Dump Road? I am not kidding. And she named the state where that unfortunate neighborhood lives and I suppose tries to rise above it. I asked if she could imagine trying to sell property listed at that address and she just chuckled. She then said, "I have one more for you. And it's subtle. The name of the street is Every Road. Doesn't sound like much does it until you give someone directions. It apparently is off a highway - I will just make the number up. So, once you exit Highway 15, turn left on Every Road." And she laughed and laughed.

    After I gotten an education from her I found my gate and waited a half hour. Then a young woman with a one year old and three-year old, a stroller and three pieces of soft luggage walked up. I looked over at her and wondered how in the world she was going to manage to handle all of that. By this time it was 8:30pm and I just looked at her. That stroller was bigger than my first car. And she was a petite little thing. I walked over to her and asked if  I could help her get everything on the plane and she seemed grateful (how could you not be?) Come to find out they had been travelling from San Francisco all day. I wanted to collapse just from the sound of it. We struck up a conversation. She grew up in the town next to Corning but they have been on the west coast for quite a while. Her husband is being considered for a position in Corning and she had come home to visit family and see if a move back might work. I asked her if her boys had ever seen snow. She thought the older one had but wouldn't remember it and the younger one definitely had not.

    We all got on the plane and while waiting, the little boy started talking to the moon. "Come on down here Godzilla where I can see you good. Move your head in the moon and come on down here. Godzilla, do you hear me? Move your head so I get to you." With an adorable lisp, he continued to talk to the moon; everyone on the plane was laughing so hard we were crying. When the plan started taxiing, he said, "Now you're moving your head. I am going to get you."

    When we deplaned in Elmira, the older boy held my hand while Momma wrestled with the younger boy and the stroller. I looked down at the boy and his eyes were chocolate saucers. He was staring at the snow piled up around the tarmac. His mother says he calls snow "white sand" so we went over to a clean pile and I scooped up some and asked him if he wanted to touch it. He held out his little hand and was startled by the sensation. He looked up at me, mouth agape.

    They walked in the terminal and found her parents. I walked in and found my Beloved. He took me home and though exhausted, I sat down and thought how could I have imagined meeting the people that I did and being given the honor of placing the first snowball into the hands of a child?</p>

    <h2>When It Comes to Breast Cancer, Hope and Pink Ribbons Are  Not A Strategy For Cure</h2>
    <h3>February 5th, 2015</h3>

    The article below was published in <em>USA Today</em> on Tuesday. The title of the article? <em>Breast cancer deaths drop dramatically over 20 years</em></span>

<span style="color: #008080;">If you have been following along with me over the past few months, you will know that what you read below is not completely accurate. Sadly for the 155,000 in the US living with metastatic cancer, it grieves us so to see a national publication send this across the nation when so much of it is skewed. In this article you will read:</span>

<span style="color: #008080;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Article:</span></strong> <span style="color: #000000;">Early detection saves lives and mammograms are one of the leading reasons in this decline.</span> </span>


<span style="color: #008080;"><strong>My response:</strong> </span><span style="color: #008080;"> Not necessarily true; mammograms cannot tell us which breast cancers will need treatment no matter how early or how often you receive a mammogram; Remember what Dr. Susan Love, surgeon and breast cancer expert said about mammograms recently? "Mammography is capable of finding about 26% of cancers at a point where it makes a life-saving difference in the outcome,<strong> it also finds many lesions which would never have gone on to be life-threatening and others which will still be life-threatening in spite of early detection and rigorous screening.</strong>"</span>


<span style="color: #008080;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Article:</strong> Women are celebrating living longer.</span> </span>


<span style="color: #008080;"><strong>My response:</strong> M</span><span style="color: #008080;">aybe they did not have metastatic disease and were never going to die from it to begin with; but  44,000 will die every year from this disease.</span>


<span style="color: #008080;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Article:</strong> There is a lot of anecdotal 'evidence' of survivorship.</span></span>


<span style="color: #008080;"><strong>My response:</strong>  When you read articles or books you will note a lot of individual storytelling of people living longer lives; the median length of survivorship of someone with metastatic disease is still three years and that hasn't moved significantly in decades.</span>


<span style="color: #008080;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Article:</strong> One reason that for the decrease is that we, as women, are "paying more attention to our bodies."</span>  </span>


<span style="color: #008080;"><strong>My response:</strong>  I paid great attention to my body and never missed a mammogram and I am dying from this disease. Do you see how crazy articles can be?</span>


<span style="color: #008080;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Article:</strong> We are told in the article to view the long-term, downward trend "optimistically and with hope from the day they hear, 'You have breast cancer.' "</span> </span>


<span style="color: #008080;"><strong>My response:</strong> You can hope all you want but it is not a strategy or an immunization against what is going on inside your body.  You may have a disease that is localized inside your breast and therefore you will NOT die from breast cancer. If your cancer starts to travel and it lands in the most common organs: liver, lungs, bone, brain you WILL die from the disease. </span><span style="color: #008080;">Remember only 7% of the 15 billion dollars allocated for breast cancer research over the last decade has gone toward finding a cure for those of us in which the disease has  spread. No amount of hope or pink ribbons is going to determine why my cancer flew on to my liver and is microscopically circulating in my body waiting to attack another organ</span>.


<strong>From USA Today:</strong>

Breast cancer deaths have dropped dramatically in the past two decades — the result of better treatment, greater awareness and more women getting mammograms.

The latest government statistics show deaths declined 34% between 1990 and 2011, from 33 to 22 per 100,000 women, and experts expect that the downward trend has continued in the four years since. The American Cancer Society says this translates into more than 200,000 deaths averted.

<div class="clearfix">Megan Schanie is among the growing ranks of survivors. After a breast cancer diagnosis in 2006, Schanie feared she might not live to see her two children grow up. But on Sunday, she celebrated her youngest daughter's 10th birthday.</div>

"It's fantastic," says Schanie, 39, who helped start a support group for young breast cancer survivors in her hometown of Louisville. "Even in my own little world, I've noticed that we have so many in our group who are surviving."

<div class="clearfix"></div>

<div class="clearfix">Otis Brawley, chief medical officer for the cancer society, which is marking World Cancer Day on Wednesday, says the biggest reason is that treatments have improved, with new medicines such as targeted chemotherapy and the estrogen blocker Tamoxifen.</div>

</div>

Meanwhile, Brawley says, awareness of the disease has risen steadily, and women now go to their doctors when something seems awry. Mammogram screenings are the third-most-important reason for the decline in deaths, he says; mammography rates among U.S. women 40 and older have risen from 29% in 1987 to 67% in the 2005-10 period.

"In the 1990s, there was this huge push to screen women with mammography, to reach women who didn't have access," says Thomas Tucker, director of the Kentucky Cancer Registry.

<p class="oembed-link-title"><em>Mayo Clinic plans trials for breast cancer vaccine</em></p>

<div> Cancer society statistics show mammography rates have leveled off in recent years, dropping slightly from 70% in 2000. Complicating matters, there are currently two different, high-profile recommendations regarding mammograms: The cancer society endorses yearly screening starting at age 40, while the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force advises screening every two years for women ages 50-74.</div>

</div>

</div>

</div>

Breast cancer experts say they aren't sure how these conflicting recommendations will affect death rates. But they expect continuing advances in breast cancer treatment. Susan Brown, managing director of health and mission program education for Susan G. Komen, the breast cancer organization, says there's a trend toward more targeted, individualized therapies as scientists learn more about the biology of tumors. And treatments will get only more personalized in the future, she says.

</div>

</div>

Schanie says she appreciates such advances. She's also glad breast cancer is no longer shrouded in secrecy as it was in decades past, and that women are paying more attention to their bodies than ever before. In her case, she woke one morning to find her right breast swollen, with a hardened area, and a biopsy confirmed cancer. She had a double mastectomy and chemotherapy and later took Tamoxifen pills and underwent breast reconstruction. She's had no signs of cancer since.

Going forward, Brawley says the breast cancer death rate may not keep dropping as quickly as it has, partly because some of the most difficult-to-treat types of cancer remain. Still, he says, "I'm very hopeful we'll continue to have a decline."

Brown says women should view the long-term, downward trend "optimistically and with hope from the day they hear, 'You have breast cancer.' </p>

<h2>One Doesn't Have to be Old to Fall, Just Ask Me or Atul Gawande</h2>
<h3> February 6th, 2015</h3>

<p>I was having a pretty uneventful day yesterday. Beloved was out of town on business. It was cold and I was still recuperating from all of my family festivities when I called Mom last evening to talk. We chatted about the party, about a recipe she had sent me and then I told her I had been reading the book that both she and a family friend had recommended by Atul Gawande,  <em>On Being Mortal: Medicine and What Matters in the End</em>. I was waxing on about how the book, for the most part, seemed to be written for older people who were staring down the barrel of old age, nursing homes etc. not for younger and middle-aged people like me who had diseases that would not get us to that point. Mom and I were talking back and forth about it, she didn't necessarily agree with me. I then told her I had no idea what I would write about for Friday's blog and asked her to say something funny so I would have some fodder to write about. She politely declined.  We continued to talk on a few minutes  and then hung up.

I padded around in my pajamas, watched the news. Beloved called and checked in. I watched a little more television until I was ready to call it a day. I don't do this when Beloved is here but when I am alone, I have a few OCD tendencies and I went to check on the patio door. Mind you that we live on the top floor and only my neighbor who has a terrace up there as well could get to me and why should she want to? She left me cupcakes yesterday by the door, hoping that I was weathering this cold weather. There is also a foot of snow on the terrace that all but covers all the furniture leaving them looking like large white mounds. Who could or would want to get me?  But nevertheless I climbed three little steps to check the lock and fell face forward on to a wicker box that we keep the cat food in and then face down on the floor. I saw stars like I have never seen in the sky, stood up and realized I had cut my upper eyelid.

<h2>After the Fall</h2>

When the thin blood started to pour (chemo changes everything) it looked like I had made some strange sacrifice out on the terrace. It was enough that I suddenly felt old, vulnerable, scared and alone.  I thought about the book that I  had just poo-pooed a couple of hours ago and thought, "Serves you right, you little smarty pants."



I called the first person I could think of - that "brother" of mine that I have spoken about before. Though he teases me mercilessly (he might tell you that that street runs both ways) he picked up the phone quickly and thought I had called to rib him about something. When he heard me crying and when I could get out that Beloved was not here, I heard him say he was on his way and the phone clicked.



He arrived within minutes bearing surgical scissors, steri-strips, and flashlight. No joking around. He got right to work. He cleaned my wound as gently as any nurse, did an assessment on me. Did I ever tell you he is a physician? He doesn't want to be named here either so I will call him <em>Little Brother</em>. He checked my pupils, compared one side of my face to the other, told me it looked a little swollen and applied the steri-strips. He then told me to sit up for a while and keep a cold compress on my eye.



Then the little brother kicked in. We have a Valentine's Ball to attend Saturday night, a fundraiser for our local hospital. The theme this year is Mardi Gras. As he was walking out after making sure I was ok, he suggested I might want to find a masquerade  mask for the evening so I could hide my swollen eye. Ha. Ha.

<h2>This Morning</h2>

This morning I woke up and texted him to tell him I was alright and to  thank him for coming out in 0 degree weather. Simultaneously, he was emailing me with this message: How are you today? Along with this picture:</p>

    <h2>Falling: It's Not Just For the Elderly Anymore</h2>

    <p>I am doing fine after my Thursday night trip up the steps. I am sporting a bit of magenta around the eye and a heavy eyelid but nothing that time won't heal - unlike other things going on in my body. I ended up not needing a masquerade mask Saturday evening. By the  time I should have been trying to either camouflage the black eye or somehow coordinate the eye shadow with my non-black eye, I just didn't think I could go out to the ball. Beloved still quite sick (and he NEVER gets sick) between the two of us, we would have brought the mood down at our table so we just stayed in.</p>

This topic may bore you to tears unless you work in healthcare or can appreciate that falling could happen to anyone. What I am trying to say again is that one's risk for falling is not limited to those in nursing homes. There are many people out there in the world who have actually dedicated their lives to understanding the causation of falls, the most noted person from the Yale School of Public Health, Dr. Mary Tinetti. An excellent resource for anyone is her Fall Prevention website:  <a title="Fall Prevention" href="http://www.fallprevention.org/pages/abs_art.htm" target="_blank">http://www.fallprevention.org/pages/abs_art.htm</a>

Every hospital in America has what is called a "falls program" with a committee of various members whose goal it is to reduce the number of falls with injury. And as I have moved through now four very different hospital organizations in my career,  I have been a part of falls teams on each and it amazes me how little many healthcare givers understand about falls and risk reduction.

In Atul Gawande's latest book that I referenced on Friday, <em>Being Mortal: Medicine and What Matters in the End</em>,  he states the three primary risk factors for falling:

<ol>

	<li>poor balance</li>

	<li>taking more than four prescriptions</li>

	<li>muscle weakness</li>

</ol>

He states that elderly people without these risk factors have a 12% chance of falling in a year. Those with all three risk factors have almost a 100% chance. I will expand on what he has written and remind those of you who do not know me that I am middle-aged, not elderly and I have all three risk factors and guess what? Down I went. And regretfully, it was not the first time and scarily probably won't be my last.

[pullquote]Elderly people without these risk factors have a 12% chance of falling in a year. Those with all three risk factors have almost a 100% chance.[/pullquote]

If you are reading this and you wonder what it has got to do with you, it may not have anything to do with you. But what about your parents? Older siblings? If you are in healthcare, it definitely means everything to you even if you are not caring for the elderly. How so?  Once an individual enters the doors of a hospital, it is my opinion and those of many others they <strong>all </strong>become fall risks. Why?

<ul>

	<li>Patients are placed in unfamiliar settings (a hospital room or exam room)</li>

	<li>At night, they are less likely to remember they are not at home and get disoriented</li>

	<li>Hospitals may or may not have night lights in the rooms or bathrooms; unlit, unfamiliar surroundings and down they go</li>

	<li>Patients are likely given medications that they were not taking at home or adding medications to their home regimen; see Gawande's #2 risk factor above.</li>

	<li>Patients will likely be under increased stress from being in the hospital and/or there without family and friends. They may attempt to try and do more independently (toileting, getting a shower, leaning over and getting water) and fall out of the bed or a chair.</li>

	<li>Hospitals may believe they provide hourly rounding for their patients but I have found time and time again that many healthcare leaders don't really even know what constitutes the make-up of an hourly round</li>

</ul>

I know I am on a soap box (and I will be careful when I step down!)  but I think everyone needs to take an updated perspective on falls and falling. Young and old alike, based on what we are doing, where we have been, it can all add up to a trip and a fall in a heartbeat. If I weren't so vain, I would take a selfie and show you what three small steps did to me! </p>

    <h2>Help Before You Fall</h2>
    <h3>February 10th, 2015</h3>

    <p>I should have known but it still caught me off guard, the number of you all who texted, emailed or commented here on the blog about the many various ways you have fallen in the past - including some very recent incidents! Falls are much more common than we would like to believe. Though I had no intention of writing once about the topic never mind a third time, I thought I would end this topic with giving you some preventions that you could check off at your home and/or the home of your loved ones.  In Dr. Tinetti's website on falls prevention, she lists the most common causes of falls. I have indicated them below with my ideas for prevention (with all due apology to Dr. Tinetti who may or may not agree with me and probably has many more that I have never thought of):

    <h2>The common health problems for falling are:</h2>

    <ol>

    	<li><strong>Problems walking or moving around</strong>

    <ol>

    	<li>Do you have difficulty when you go shopping? Can you navigate through stores?</li>

    	<li>Do you have difficulty walking if you have to park far away from the store? Do you need to apply for a handicapped parking sticker?</li>

    </ol>

    </li>

    	<li><strong>Four or more medications</strong>

    <ol>

    	<li>If you see more than one physician, does each caregiver know what you are taking, in totality?</li>

    	<li>If you go to the Emergency Room or are admitted, do you know everything you are taking? Do you have a list and can you provide it to your caregiver?</li>

    	<li>You will hear the term "medication reconciliation" spoken in hospitals and doctors' offices and that is the nearly impossible task of keeping up with your meds, any changes in dosages, any new or discontinued items. While so important, we as a nation have realized how awesomely difficult the task is - can  you/your family member help the caregiver by providing updated information every time you are seen? There a lots of templates online that you can complete and take with you.</li>

    </ol>

    </li>

    	<li><strong>Foot problems, unsafe footwear</strong>

    <ol>

    	<li>That would be me last week. I was wearing scuffs, no backing on my shoe and a little worn, enough that I did a slide up the steps.</li>

    	<li>If you have diabetes, you know your fingers and toes can and do go numb, known as neuropathy, this is a definite factor in trips and falls. Your feet have decreased sensation and if not careful, you could be headed downward; and not just diabetes, chemotherapeutic agents can cause the same numbing.</li>

    	<li>Untied shoes, tripping on laces</li>

    	<li>Shoes that simply don't fit.</li>

    	<li>High heels, clogs, think of what we put our feet through and expect them to get us from here to there without incident!</li>

    </ol>

    </li>

    	<li><strong>Blood pressure drops too much on standing up/dizzy</strong>

    <ol>

    	<li>Link this problem with #2 and you can see how medications (or polypharmacy as it is called in healthcare) can be overwhelmingly causative of falls; if your healthcare providers don't know what you are taking, the mixing of medications can cause all kinds of untoward side effects, blood pressure drops being just one</li>

    </ol>

    </li>

    	<li><strong>Problems with seeing</strong>

    <ol>

    	<li>Sounds pretty obvious but if you wear glasses, when was the last time you had your eyes checked?</li>

    	<li>Is your driveway well lit not only for you but for guests?</li>

    	<li>How about your porch? Is the light working? Is it bright enough? Basement lights working?</li>

    	<li>Do you have handrails outside at your steps? How about sturdy handrails going down to your basement?</li>

    	<li>Silly, but is your hair in your eyes? Do you need a haircut?</li>

    	<li>Do you have nightlights throughout your home? If you are a night time snacker, is your pathway lit for your late night feasts?</li>

    </ol>

    </li>

    	<li><strong>Tripping hazards in your home</strong>

    <ol>

    	<li>Do you need to rearrange furniture to allow better maneuvering through your living space?</li>

    	<li>Are there too many items on the floor (decorative or otherwise) that could cause you to trip?</li>

    	<li>Do you have a pet or two who may circle through your feet and potentially cause you to stumble?</li>

    	<li>Do you have slick magazines lying around waiting on you to slide on them?</li>

    	<li>Are spills from humans or pets cleaned up as soon as they happen?</li>

    </ol>

    </li>

    </ol>

    I think you have gotten the point. For those who are caring for or who are checking in on older loved ones, you may get their attention and assistance with these hints above if they know that for those over 70, 16% of all Emergency Department visits are due to falls and fall-related injuries. Keeping healthy is difficult enough; some things are just not within our control to change (like cancer!); others we can at least help mitigate. I hope you find this helpful.

    Mom says it's time for less technical stuff. I will see what I can do for tomorrow.</p>

    <h2>A Chance Encounter with a Purple Horse: Happy Anniversary Mom & Dad</h2>
    <h3>Februrary 11th, 2015</h3>

    <p>My mother left me a message last night saying she had meant to call earlier  but had gotten tied up with running errands all day. Then she reminded me that it was her wedding anniversary and that they were staying in and dining on shrimp cocktail...I suddenly had a flashback from a year or so ago. We were at a family gathering and had walked out onto the sidewalk (Mom, Dad and I). Mom, in usual fashion, had left something back in the restaurant and we waited while she retrieved whatever it was. Dad was slowly headed back her way when I stopped in the entryway of an art gallery and was looking at a rather large painting of a purple horse. Yes, I know what you are thinking and no I was not drunk. It really was a very large painting.  I looked up and a homeless man who was farther along in his liquid celebration than I, looked at me and asked, "What is that thing?" I stood there thinking, "Oh this is going to go over <strong><em>so</em></strong> well.....It's a purple horse."

    "No it ain't," he bellowed! "Don't you know a raging bull when you see one?" Never one to argue with a drunk person, I acquiesced but he could tell I was just pandering. "Cain't you see his raging nose? His horns? Don't you see it?" At just that moment Mom and Dad walked up, looked over at the two of us, smiled and kept walking. The homeless fellow yelled out to Mom, "Hey! Don't be mad at your husband. Come on. Forgive him. Fifty years of marriage. You gotta forgive him" And the two of us started following them. We passed by two young men who were seated at a table outside and I heard one of them say, "Oh this is going to get interesting." But those guys didn't  budge.

    As the fellow and I walked behind Mom and Dad my new friend remarked, "Andy and Aunt Bea. Don't they make the loveliest couple?" "Couple?" I said loudly enough for Mom and Dad to hear me. "Fifty years? Those two old hippies finally made me legitimate last year."  I thought my new homeless friend was going to have to sit down on the sidewalk to compose himself he laughed so hard.

    We finally stopped at an intersection and he got in front of Mom and Dad, made his hands into L-shapes to mimic a television screen and said, "Andy and Aunt Bea...Aunt Bea and Andy...a fine couple" and out he walked into traffic until Mom pulled him back on the curb. The light changed at that moment. We walked straight ahead and he turned right, walking down the street, shaking his head and laughing, "What a cute couple."</p>

    <h2>The Conversation</h2>
    <h3>February 12th, 2015</h3>

    <p>If you were to ask me what is the most difficult thing I deal with, I would tell you it is letting me talk about death and dying - what I do and do not want to occur both on this side of life and what I want you to do when I am on the other. If you know me, you know that I couch a lot of things in the cloak of humor because as they say, "just a spoon full of sugar helps the medicine go down.." and it's true.  In a very southern way when I say something to my mother and it creeps up on the edge of death, she will say, "if you don't shut up, I am going to smack you." Don't be alarmed. That is a <em>very</em>  southern thing to say, no matter how old the child is. But it is her way of saying, "I can't talk about that or I don't want to talk about that or talk to someone else about that..." And I get it. I really do.

    I was perusing through the New York Times this morning and came upon one of their "most emailed stories." If you don't read the NYT, every day they will list the top ten stories at the moment that readers are emailing to family and friends. The topics vary widely and I do get a kick of what is making the rounds. It could be anything from Obamacare to some strange recipe for artichokes. You never know. But one of the top stories today was about a woman who had recently died and the title of the article was <a title="Seeking a Beautiful Death" href="http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/02/09/know-the-hard-choices-prolonging-life-entails/?smprod=nytcore-ipad&amp;smid=nytcore-ipad-share" target="_blank"><em>Seeking a Beautiful Death </em></a>by Jane Brody.

    In it, the author quotes Dr. Angelo E. Volandes,  author of a new book, <em>The Conversation. </em> A lot like the book I have been quoting by Atul Gawande (<em>Being Mortal</em>) the author says as Americans we have access to the best medical care in the world yet we often die some of the worst deaths in the world. Why?  Because we do not  have the "conversation" that would outline what we do and do not want at the end of our lives. I am not talking about those of us with terminal illnesses. I mean, as do these authors, <strong>all of us</strong> whether young or old, sick or well.

    The list of questions that Dr. Volandes made (and that Ms. Brody used in her article)  is so spot-on that I don't need to add anything to it. The questions are vital for everyone to have answers to:

    <ul>

    	<li>What gives your life meaning and joy?</li>

    	<li>What are your biggest fears and concerns?</li>

    	<li>What are you looking forward to?</li>

    	<li>What goals are most important to you now?</li>

    	<li>What trade-offs or sacrifices are you willing to make to achieve those goals?</li>

    </ul>

    Make sure that you, as the future patient, have answers to these questions AND that you have shared them with someone who will be making decisions on your behalf. Having this information locked inside your heart is going to do no one any good if you have not shared it with family or friends.

    And all of this leads me back to my chemotherapy decision. I had my last PET scan a couple of weeks ago if you remember. And the liver spots had shown a decrease in activity. I was supposed to have been back to my oncologist  by now but had to reschedule my appointment. I am planning to see her today, Thursday, to discuss future treatment. I have decided I do not want to try either of the two chemos that she suggested to me when I had such a bad reaction to the Kadcyla. I am, however, going to accept a markedly reduced dosage and determine how I feel afterward. My family knows of this decision. I am not sure how they feel about it but they accept it and stand behind me while we see what happens. We all understand that they might not make the same decision, but they understand that it is the decision I need to make for me. </p>

    <h2>Football and Copperheads</h2>
    <h3>Februrary 13th, 2015</h3>

    <p>So Mom called after the "purple horse" story to relive that crazy evening. Although I am accused of hyperbole, that story was exactly the way that it happened. I mean, who could have made that up? As we talked along, she told me it was a beautiful day in NC and it was time she went out to "pull a few weeds." While other women go and get pedicures to relax, Mom likes to go out and rip up stuff out of the ground. Though I have told you of the many ways we are similar, we are NOT similar when it comes to getting crud under our nails. When I asked her why in February she needed to go out yet again and pull stuff up, she answered, "Because right now the little snakes are asleep. If I wait until spring, they will be awake and might try to bite me."</p>

Which reminded me of a story from last year. Mom had been out yet again in the winter doing whatever she does out there and came upon a copperhead who I guess had forgotten to turn his clock back and was wide awake apparently looking for a fight. Well, when Mom doesn't have a chainsaw in her hand, she usually has a shovel. And good thing she did that day.  While Pop was deep into a football game siting on the sofa, Mom was out in the front yard decapitating a copperhead with her sturdy shovel. Never one to make a big deal out of killing snakes, she pushed it aside and kept working.

Later that afternoon, she came inside, Pop was well into another game and she said, "Jim I killed a copperhead a while ago in the yard." And if you love football or know someone who does, you learn you do not talk to the football fan and if you expect conversation, it usually  sounds like cavemen grunts unless you ask them during halftime. It wasn't halftime and apparently Dad grunted. Mom, still being very new to this marriage thing didn't think that was reverence enough for what she had gone and done to keep home and hearth safe. So she went outside, scooped up the beheaded snake and served it to him on a shovel in the family room.

I am not privy to what he said, but I understand she got both his attention and his respect!</p>

    <h2>Treatment Update</h2>
    <h3>February 13th, 2015</h3>

    <p>I just got home from seeing my oncologist. Due to a couple of scheduling mix-ups, it had been several weeks as you know since I had been to see her. I heard through the nurse grapevine that everyone thought I had ditched the whole thing and had gone off to I am not sure where! A great story but obviously not true. After showing my physician my black eye, we talked chemo. I swear to you that she got a little misty-eyed when I told her I was willing to try the lowered dose Kadcyla - - once! And then to see how I reacted. So that's what I did.

    I am back home. I've had dinner, scratched the cats and am sitting here feeling like there is a ticking time bomb in my belly. Not really...</p>

    <h2>Valentine Weekend</h2>
    <h3>February 16th, 2015</h3>

    <p>Saturday night we went out with the true ambassadors of Corning, the couple who really sealed the deal with us coming to Corning. Often on a whim one of us will text the other and say, "Let's meet at Tony's for a drink." Tony's is the 'older hangout' that I have written about. It sits across from the town square where East Market Street meets West Market. It used to be a bank and indeed they do keep their wines in the vault. It reminds me of where the rat pack of the 50's would have hung out if they had been in the area. The young kids go further down Market to the Cellar where it is louder and where they sell many more kinds of martinis. The young set say that Tony's is too expensive but I don't think that is true.

Beloved and I arrived first. I know exactly what to order before they get there. Or Nick the bartender goes ahead without me and makes the four drinks when he sees the whites of our eyes. When the four of us settled down and started catching up from the week, a snow squall hit like you would not believe. I had to run out in it - still southern in many ways  - and marvel at the intensity of the snowfall. In the south for the most part, we are used to flakes that came down the size of doilies and lazily make their way to the ground and then melt within the next 12 hours. I tried to explain to a friend recently that snow here often is the size of a grain of salt and it pours down out of the sky like pouring out of a shaker.

<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.sherrifillipo.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/snowsherri.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1808 size-full" src="http://www.sherrifillipo.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/snowsherri-e1424102505515.jpg" alt="snowsherri" width="240" height="320" /></a></p>

 We had a great time, eating and drinking. The snow kept coming. Finally we parted ways and walked home. We always have a great time when we are together.

Many of you know I have been begging for a hedgehog for quite awhile. Half way serious and half way to get beloved's goat. He could think of nothing worse than having to deal with another mouth to feed and box to clean. So for one of my Valentine gifts, he gave me a hedgehog:

<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.sherrifillipo.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/hedgehog-2.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1810" src="http://www.sherrifillipo.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/hedgehog-2-231x300.jpg" alt="hedgehog (2)" width="231" height="300" /></a></p>

  He found it rummaging through one of the antique stores on Market Street. I was able to love it for all of one day. Let me tell you what chemo does. Before we went out for drinks, I photographed it to send to Mom. We came back and the darn thing was gone. I looked all over the apartment Sunday and cannot find him. I mean everywhere - freezer, pockets, drawers, boxes...what on earth did I do with it? It is tiny, could sit in your hand but for heaven sake, I thought I photographed it and then I THOUGHT I set it down on the kitchen counter...

If you find him, would you send him home?</p>

    <h2>What I need to Remember</h2>
    <h3>February 17th, 2015</h3>

    <p>Yesterday's devotional from the book I have recommended in the past, <em>Jesus Calling</em>, really spoke to me. Here is the first paragraph:

    <blockquote><span style="color: #008080;">Thank me for the conditions that are requiring you to be still. Do not spoil these quiet hours by wishing them away, waiting impatiently to be active again. Some of the greatest works in My kingdom have been done from sick beds and prison cells...Do not despise these simple ways [quietness and trust] of serving Me. Although you feel cut off from the activity of the world, your quiet trust makes a powerful statement in spiritual realms.</span></blockquote>

    I had to read it over and over again. Some days I wake up and I've "got it" meaning I understand that my purpose in life has shifted and I am having to do more on the sidelines. Other days to be honest, I miss my suits, folders, meeting agendas  and former purpose for being. This devotional pulled me back - got my attention. I have to remember just as I am no longer 24, 34, or 44, I am no longer a hospital nurse, no longer director of projects, doer of things. I am now a sitter and reflector. A pray-er for family, friends and sometimes strangers. I need to remember to bend and be flexible and change as God asks me to.

    Well, I've gone and caught Beloved's chest cold. That's the way it is when you are immunocompromised. If not careful, you will pick up all kinds of bugs. Even when you are careful. Your body simply isn't as strong as it once was. So, I will close for today and allow post-chemo and gunky cold to allow me to sit and further ponder this devotion. The irony of the timing isn't lost on me.</p>

    <h2>Market Street</h2>
    <h3>February 18th, 2018</h3>

    <p>I am so under the weather (whine whine) but I am most upset that one of my ya-ya's who was supposed to come up tomorrow to visit me isn't coming, at my request. Between the chemo and the chest cold, I told her it was probably wise to stay away and it broke my heart...we will get together, she will come up here but I was so excited to see her. She and I have had many a margarita together over the years and I was so looking forward to having time to do so again. (I live across the street from a Mexican restaurant.)

I was lying here blowing my nose when my stepdaughter emailed me and sent me this posting. It was from last year but I never saw it. It just confirms what I love about my adopted home and since I don't feel like posting today, I thought you all should see more of "my" main street and let someone else do the writing.

    <h2>Lorena Rojas and Shirley Temple Black: Two Different Breast Cancers</h2>
    <h3>February 19th, 2015</h3>

    <p> Lorena Rojas, a soap opera actress, died on Monday at the age of 44 from metastatic breast cancer according to the New York Times. She was originally diagnosed in 2008. After she learned of her disease, she made it her mission to reach out to the Latino communities to educate them about breast cancer. She was well known in Mexico and internationally on Spanish-speaking television.



<strong>Born:</strong> 1974 <strong>Breast cancer diagnosis:</strong> 2008 <strong>Metastatic Breast Cancer Diagnosis:</strong> 2013  <strong>Died:</strong> 2015   She was 44.


<a href="http://www.sherrifillipo.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/shirley-temple.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1834" src="http://www.sherrifillipo.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/shirley-temple-300x200.jpg" alt="handprints in Hollywood Boulevard in the concrete of Chinese The" width="300" height="200" /></a>Shirley Temple Black should have been credited for bringing the topic of breast cancer out into the open although I along with just about everyone else credits Betty Ford with that distinction. In the New York Times, there was a very nice section on notable deaths of 2014 and as I was looking through them I read the article about how Shirley Temple Black turned the medical world on its ear by refusing what at the time was the standard procedure for a breast biopsy. If the biopsy was determined to be malignant, while still under anesthesia, the surgeon would remove the breast. According to the NYT, she would have nothing to do with that process. I loved her quote, "I find intellectually distasteful the prospect of waking up and finding that someone else had made a decision and taken action in which I, lying quite inert on the operating table, had had no voice." Wow! I wish I had said that!

Later on in the article note this:

<blockquote><span style="color: #000000;">Betty Ford is often credited with breaking that public silence. But Black beat her to it by two years. What’s more, while Ford’s revelation may have been extraordinary, her response to her illness was not. When an early patient activist, for instance, begged her to legitimize the two-step procedure by undergoing it herself, the first lady refused, explaining, through an intermediary, “The president has made his decision.” As for Black, the American Cancer Society scolded her for her defiance, fearing that other women might follow her lead, demanding input into their treatment and questioning their doctors’ authority. They did and still do today.</span></blockquote>

Unlike Lorena Rojas, Shirley Temple Black did not die from breast cancer. She died from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

<strong>Born:</strong> 1928  <strong>Breast cancer diagnosis:</strong> 1972  <strong>Died:</strong> 2014    She was 86.</p>

    <h2>A Response From the Metastatic Breast Cancer Network I Did Not Expect</h2>
    <h3>February 20th, 2015</h3>

    <p>Last week I submitted my blog <em>The Conversation</em> to the Metastatic Breast Cancer Network (MBCN) in hope that they might think it worthy to disseminate throughout its members as they did with my Joan Lunden blog from several months back. If you will recall, in this most recent blog, I wrote about how important it was to have conversations with healthcare providers, family and friends about one's desires at the end of life - things  one wanted done as much as those things one would not want done in the end.  I made a point of writing that this conversation was for the ill and the well.  I was not expecting the response I received and I am still ruminating (this is most of the response but not all):

    <blockquote><em><span style="color: #008080;">End of life is so important for all of us, but, as you say, it is one of the most difficult things to deal with. At MBCN we do not have anything on our website about end of life. This was a conscious decision made when the organization was founded in 2004. At that time, metastatic breast cancer was viewed only as an immediate death sentence and we have worked hard to overcome that narrow view and emphasize people living with metastatic disease and seeking more and better treatments to make mbc a chronic disease.</span></em>

    <div><em><span style="color: #008080;">Now that we are in 2015, we believe that attitudes towards mbc are changing. It is not viewed strictly and automatically as preparing for death as your only and main option. Therefore, we are thinking of adding a section to the website to address the issue and we will certainly include some of the links you have mentioned.</span></em></div></blockquote>

    <div>While I suppose I can see their point in 2004 but ten years later they still don't address death on their website?</div>

    <div></div>

    <div>Am I the only one scratching my head on this one?</div>

    <div></div>

    <div>I am dumbfounded.</div></p>

    <h2>Weekend Update: MBCN Responds To Conversation Blog</h2>
    <h3>February 21st, 2015</h3>

    <p>After I posted yesterday's blog, I continued to ruminate and I began to wonder if I could be off-base. I also am a member of <a href="https://www.inspire.com/search/?query=&amp;submit.x=11&amp;submit.y=6">Inspire</a> an umbrella group made up of  different health communities. One can sign up and join any of a number of disease-specific groups; I recently joined the advanced breast cancer support group. Last evening, I copied and pasted the blog with the MBCN response asking this support group  if they could help me with the philosophy of MBCN since I was a newbie to both groups. I was interested in hearing from people who are living (and dying) with the same disease as I am. I received a couple of responses.

    This morning I received a response from MBCN and they have decided to re-post <em>The Conversation</em> after all. I believe the group was further along in their desire to add end of life care type discussions than I was able to read into the correspondence that came to me. As  I have written, MBCN is a wealth of information at one's fingertips. I have read and re-read many of their documents over the last year. I am happy on many levels that this group is adding a new and very important topic to its repository.</p>

    <h2>Lymphedema 101</h2>
    <h3>February 23rd, 2015</h3>

      <p>Have you ever noticed women wearing what looks like a thick ace bandage on an arm? More than likely they are suffering from a side effect of breast cancer surgery called lymphedema. Lymphedema is a swelling of an area where lymph nodes have been removed. The lymphatic system is a drainage system, if you will, for your body to move fluid through the body and out. If the remaining fluid cannot exit via the remaining nodes, your body part will swell as there is nowhere for the fluid to travel. The Mayo Clinic estimates up to 3 million cases are diagnosed in the US annually.

      Sometimes lymphedema will start soon after surgery or radiation. Sometimes, however, it will take months or years for this phenomenon to occur. As this is one of the few things I have not experienced, it had not dawned on me to discuss it here until Mom and I were talking about a television program she had seen recently with the actress Kathy Bates.  She had been interviewed about how this condition had really taken a toll on her. I did not realize that she was diagnosed in 2012 with bilateral breast cancer and had undergone bilateral mastectomies.

      Not every woman will be affected with lymphedema and according to the American Cancer Society, there is still much to learn about this phenomenon. What they do know now is that:

      <ul>

      	<li>the risk is higher if you have surgery and radiation</li>

      	<li>the risk increases with the number of lymph nodes that are removed</li>

      	<li>the risk is higher in obese patients</li>

      </ul>

      <strong>Signs and symptoms of early lymphedema include:</strong>

      <ul>

      	<li>swelling in the hand, arm, chest area</li>

      	<li>part of your body feels heave</li>

      	<li>skin changes: red, hot etc.</li>

      	<li>new aching, tingling in an area</li>

      	<li>less flexibility in nearby joints</li>

      	<li>difficulty when you dress (putting your arms through sleeves or jackets)</li>

      	<li>articles no longer fit including bras, rings, bracelets even though you have not gained weight</li>

      </ul>

      <strong>So what do you do if you have this condition?</strong>

      <ul>

      	<li>Make sure that your physician knows that you have an arm or leg that is swelling</li>

      	<li>In addition to wearing a compression sleeve (the thing that looks like an ace bandage) some patients have access to specially trained physical therapists who can offer massage as a way to help your body move the accumulated fluid</li>

      	<li>If you have lymphedema in your arm(s):

      <ul>

      	<li>wear loose, non-binding clothing</li>

      	<li>do not allow healthcare providers to draw blood or start an IV on the affected limb</li>

      	<li>use a thimble when sewing</li>

      	<li>use extra caution when cooking so as not to burn the affected limb</li>

      </ul>

      </li>

      </ul>

      I have only scratched the surface of a condition that is all too real for millions of men and women. But this may be enough to get you started if you or someone you know has it.  I used a great resource for this posting and have placed the link here if you are interested in more information: <a title="American Cancer Society: Lymphedema Facts" href="http://www.cancer.org/acs/groups/cid/documents/webcontent/002876-pdf.pdf" target="_blank">Lymphedema facts from the American Cancer Society</p>

        <h2>The Conversation Follow-up</h2>
        <h3>February 24th, 2015</h3>

        <p>At the risk of becoming known as the Dr. Kevorkian of bloggers (!) over the last week, I have had a number of friends, family and readers tell me stories of how end of life discussions have occurred and not occurred in a variety of situations. Some have gone well. Some never occurred leaving the bereaved bewildered.



        As uncomfortable as many people are with approaching the topic of death and dying, many still indicated, and I wholeheartedly agree that no one wanted to give their loved ones, one more thing to do during the most difficult time of his/her life - that being to determine what would my wife/husband/mother/father/friend want me to do right now? Things as critical as when to stop treatment? CPR? No CPR? Ventilator? No ventilator? Burial? Cremation? Service? No service? Less critical but still important: Flowers? No flowers? Music? What kind? Scripture? Which charities to highlight in an obituary? On and on I could go.



        I may be wrong but I tend to think if you could see having this conversation as a gift, it might be an easier conversation to have with someone. And I might add, you don't have to do it in one fell swoop. You can take it small steps at a time. A reader told me she was glad that I had written that it was important for both the ill and the well to start having the conversation. "Because," as she said, "You never know."

        <h2>For Those With Advanced Cancer</h2>

        For those of us who are a little further ahead  in need of having these conversations, when it comes to your healthcare provider, for some it can be intimidating. (I wish it weren't so.)  I have posted a link here that might help. It is from an organization, Choosing Wisely, an initiative of the American Board of Internal Medicine. On the website there are many topics listed, written for the public, to use as a springboard for conversation with their physicians. This one <a title="End of Life Care" href="http://www.choosingwisely.org/doctor-patient-lists/care-at-the-end-of-life-for-advanced-cancer-patients/">Care at the End of Life for Advanced Cancer Patients</a><a title="Care at the End of Life" href="http://https://fbcdn-sphotos-a-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xpf1/v/t1.0-9/p403x403/10443541_10152742563691220_4053363522420534112_n.jpg?oh=5f8f06e303e65209f5b1105c2643b9b9&amp;oe=55961EFB&amp;__gda__=1434851053_f4dd2863b2763764d4bcebda0b2a0b6f"> </a> offers a list of  questions to take to your physician that you might want answered such as:

        <ul>

        	<li>Are there things I can do to make my quality of life better?</li>

        	<li>How long do I have to live if I have more treatment?</li>

        	<li>What will happen if I do not have more treatment?</li>

        </ul>

        There may be some questions you don't want to ask and if so don't bring them up. The point of these educational information sheets is to start a dialogue that may be easier for some if they have a guideline. On a personal note, I have noticed that unless I bring up the topic of end of life with my oncologist and my oncology nurses, they will not bring it up! So, if you are waiting for this particular subject to be brought up, unless you do it, it might not get initiated.



        And finally, the concept of hospice and palliative care continues to be so misunderstood. I have placed a link here from the same organization which provides easy to understand information on both topics. <a title="Hospice and Palliative Care" href="http://www.choosingwisely.org/doctor-patient-lists/palliative-care/">Hospice and Palliative Care</a> </p>

          <h2>One Woman's Thoughts on Talking About Cancer</h2>
          <h3>February 25th, 2015</h3>

          <p>I have become very aware through blogging how difficult it is for some people to talk about cancer nevermind end of life conversations. I don't know if it is my personality or that I have been a nurse for such a long time but I think I could ask someone just about anything or listen as they tell me just about anything without being too uncomfortable. One of my "golden girls" (past post) once said a minister had preached that a person can only go as deep with someone else as they have gone with themselves.  I agree that those who have taken a deep dive within themselves can dive deep with others - those that haven't cannot and will avoid it.

          <h2>What to Say to People with Cancer</h2>

          I was noodling around on the internet today and stumbled upon a website of "10 things cancer patients love to hear." It is from a website for cancer support and this website asked cancer patients what they like to hear from family and friends. Personally, I  agree with most of them but not all; yet, if you have trouble reaching out to neighbors, friends, co-workers or family, this may be a good place to start.



          <strong>Here is their list:</strong>

          <ol>

          	<li>I don't know what to say but I am here for you.</li>

          	<li>I'll ride the waves with you until the storm calms.</li>

          	<li>I'm here to listen.</li>

          	<li>Let me help with.....and be specific not "if you ever need anything, just let me know"</li>

          	<li>What have you been up to? How is your family? Talk to me about anything but cancer.</li>

          	<li>I love to hear the phone ring or that I have a text.</li>

          	<li>You'll be in my prayers.</li>

          	<li>I have mail.</li>

          	<li>Where can I learn more?</li>

          	<li>How about a hug?</li>

          </ol>

          My favorite? I am here to listen. My least favorite? You'll be in my prayers. Surprised? Because as I have gotten older, I am more aware of the need to only say it if you mean it. Please don't tell me you are going to pray for me if you aren't.

          <h2>What Not to Say to People with Cancer</h2>

          How about the reverse? What do cancer patients not want to hear? This is my personal list so only blame me if you disagree!

          <ol>

          	<li>A good scan? You should be happy with that news!</li>

          	<li>Your (metastatic) cancer hasn't spread to the lungs/bones/liver/brain? You should be happy!</li>

          	<li>Well, you know...we are all dying.</li>

          	<li>Eat more green vegetables....take vitamins....etc.</li>

          	<li>I had a friend who was given xx amount of time and she lived 20 years.</li>

          	<li>Your bald head doesn't offend me in the least.</li>

          	<li>Does cancer run in your family?</li>

          	<li>You're thinking about stopping treatment?</li>

          	<li>You are so lucky you don't have to work.</li>

          	<li>You must be angry with God.</li>

          </ol>

          I am not angry with anybody. In fact as strange as it sounds, in many ways I am as happy as I have ever been. It reminds me of a verse from the book of Philippians  that for years I read quizzically wondering how it would feel to live those words but in the past 2-3 years, I can honestly say I am there:



          <span style="color: #008080;">I know what it is to be in need, and I know what it is to have plenty. I have learned the secret of being content in any and every situation, whether well fed or hungry, whether living in plenty or in want. Philippians 4:12<span class="p">

      <h2>Miscellaneous Nonsense</h2>
      <h3>February 26th, 2015</h3>

      <p>Sometimes I need to be arbitrary. Today is one of those days....for those of you who know about my sudden fascination with hedgehogs (I don't know why) you will know that Beloved gave me a ceramic one for Valentine's Day and I had it for all of one day until chemo brain kicked in and I lost him. Well, guess what? He showed back up....with a girlfriend.  I shoulda known.



  <a href="http://www.sherrifillipo.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/two-hedgehogs-e1424890379750.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1900" src="http://www.sherrifillipo.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/two-hedgehogs-e1424890379750-300x300.jpg" alt="two hedgehogs" width="300" height="300" /></a>



  &nbsp;



  And I think I have really taken a lifetime of falls research and figured it out. I read this on Facebook (yes, I have gone to the dark side - ha) and I do believe I know now the causation for falls:



  <span style="color: #008080;">I am not a falls risk. It's just that the floor hates me, tables and chairs are bullies and walls get in my way! </span>

  <p style="text-align: left;">For those of you who need a little encouragement today, I really liked this list below, especially the one that states cancer "cannot invade the soul." It reminded me of what is called the blood-brain barrier which doesn't allow many things to cross it, a way to protect the most vital of organs.</p>

  <p style="text-align: left;"><strong>What cancer cannot do:</strong></p>

  <p style="text-align: left;">It cannot cripple love</p>

  <p style="text-align: left;">It cannot shatter hope</p>

  <p style="text-align: left;">It cannot dissolve faith</p>

  <p style="text-align: left;">It cannot destroy peace</p>

  <p style="text-align: left;">It cannot kill friendship</p>

  <p style="text-align: left;">It cannot suppress memories</p>

  <p style="text-align: left;">It cannot silence courage</p>

  <p style="text-align: left;">It cannot invade the soul</p>

  <p style="text-align: left;">It cannot steal eternal life</p>

  <p style="text-align: left;">It cannot conquer the spirit</p>

    <h2>What We Wish You Knew</h2>
    <h3>February 28th, 2015</h3>

    <p><h3><strong>Things cancer patients wish you knew (or understood):</strong></h3>

    <ul>

    	<li>We know we say we are tired all the time. But the sad thing is, it is true. The fatigue is unlike non-cancer fatigue in my opinion. It is somehow deeper or more encompassing than what I remember from several years ago.</li>

    	<li>Some days we can eat; other days we cannot. If we join you for dinner or go out to a restaurant, we will eat what we think we can stomach but you  may think we choose strange items. Carbohydrates seem to settle my stomach. I was never much of a bread person, but I find now that it is one thing that I can eat so I do. Sometimes that is all I eat for a meal.</li>

    	<li>One day we feel well enough to visit you or have you visit us; the next day we can hardly imagine getting out of our pajamas and meeting anyone to do anything.</li>

    	<li>Some of our chemos make racing to the bathroom something we have to do at a moment's notice. In some situations it is more comfortable to explain to you why we are cutting you off in mid-sentence to run than others.</li>

    	<li>Sometimes we turn down an offer to a social event because of the GI problems when we otherwise feel pretty good. Being placed in situations where a quick discreet exit to a bathroom  is not possible can be very stressful.</li>

    	<li>Some days we  feel we can talk on the phone; other days we simply can't or don't want to. Leaving voicemail messages that don't make us feel guilty about not picking up makes it easier for us.</li>

    	<li>Some days we feel social; other days we just need to be alone. Sometimes you never know which way it is going to be. We may seem fickle but we are riding on a rollercoaster every day, one on which we cannot get off.</li></p>
