        <h2>My Upcoming Weekend</h2>
        <h3>January 2nd, 2015</h3>

        <p> Today is a good day. My son is on his way here for the first time. He has a few days off before his last semester
            of school starts and we are going to spend it together. He is to arrive around 3:00pm. He has never been this
            far north and thinks it will be an adventure. I am hoping I can make it so! Tonight we are going out with friends
            to the cool, young, hip restaurant on Market Street for drinks and dinner. (Does it ever feel normal drinking
            with your child?) Over the weekend, we plan to do some wine tastings/spirits tastings/beer tastings through the
            finger lakes. I have tried to explain the lakes to him but as I also had difficulty understanding them, he will
            have to see them to really get the concept. I remember when Beloved and I went to the champagne winery and the
            woman there said that an Indian legend was that God placed His hand over the region and blessed it, hence the
            name. I like the way that sounds and if you have ever spent a fall afternoon driving through them, you would
            agree.

            <!-- Some picture goes here -->
            As a true southerner, he texted me at midnight asking if it was snowing here. I was delighted to tell him indeed it was!
            (Wait til I show him the outside hockey rink down the block!) We also hope to spend some time applying for paramedic
            positions while he is here so he won't have that added burden once class starts back. An ambitious agenda but
            he always says when he is with me, he gets a lot of things done. I take that as a compliment.</p>

        <h2>A River of Tears</h2>
        <h3>January 6th, 2015</h3>

        <p>I sent my son off yesterday around noon, back to the warmer south. I do believe that if I had arrived back at the
            apartment and noticed that the river behind us had gone dry, I could have walked down to its banks and filled
            it with tears. Highly dramatic I know but that is how I felt leaving him at the airport. My son and I had already
            had one of those last minute deep conversations that you sometimes have at the end of a visit, things you had
            been saving to say for hours or days or weeks. He and I had already been teary, had had some philosophical disagreements
            on life and family. That's nothing to worry about. He has always been a deep thinker. Remember he is the one
            last summer who wanted to know from me how it felt to be living with one foot on earth and the other in heaven.
            After I watched him go through security, I walked over into the airport restaurant which has a large window allowing
            you to look through to the boarding area. I stood there just watching him. That's when I noticed a younger woman
            standing near me. When he looked back just as he was walking on to the tarmac, he tapped the wall with his hand
            and waved at me. I lost it. The young woman turned to me and said, "My son got to stay here an extra week due
            to flight cancellations.....headed back to school...a mother's love....." She smiled and shook her head. I think
            she thought we were in the same boat, sending college boys off to spring semester..Yes, I replied they just don't
            know the depth of a mother's love. She asked something that made me clarify that no, he wasn't leaving home,
            he was headed home. She then said something that made me indicate that the two college boys headed to the plane
            were in completely different places. I looked up and told her that I had breast cancer and he being so far away
            was exceedingly difficult. And at that point I was wringing my tissue like a wet washcloth. Being as supportive
            as she could realizing that she had misread the entire 15 minutes we had stood there looking at our sons, she
            said, "Well, I hope you are doing ok with it." Completely unfiltered and coming apart, I told her that I was
            doing ok but that it was terminal. She empathetically said, "You poor thing." I, indeed felt like a poor thing
            yesterday. Later, grocery shopping and going to the post office, I cried in between errands. I got home by 3:30pm,
            took a shower and put on my pajamas. I couldn't think to do anything else. I sat on the couch and cried for hours.
            I didn't wake up until noon today, something I am not proud to admit but I have spent the afternoon on the couch
            thinking and praying about our time. I need to clarify that we did have a great time. And I want to write about
            that too. I just don't think I had thought about how difficult the closure of our time would be. The forecast
            for the next three days is snow with highs in the teens which suits me just fine. I think I need some time to
            sit and process.</p>

        <h2>End of Life Discussions</h2>
        <h3>January 7th, 2015</h3>


        <p>In a recent Wall Street Journal article entitled,
            <em>Why Doctors Die Differently</em>,
            <a title="Why Doctors Die Differently" href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052970203918304577243321242833962 "
                target="_blank">http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052970203918304577243321242833962 </a>I found the information compelling
            and wanted to share it with you. As time marches on with me, I have had several brief conversations with friends
            who happen to be healthcare providers at the hospital nearest me and with select family members and non-caregiver
            friends. I would encourage you to read it and if I may be so bold, I would ask you to start thinking about what
            you would want done and NOT done if you ever found yourself in my situation or any of a dozen other situations
            where you needed to spell out your final wishes. In the article, research found that about 64% of doctors had
            an advanced directive; whereas only 20% of the general population did. And advanced directive outlines end-of-life
            decisions that you want your healthcare providers to make/not make on your behalf. I know I have a distinct advantage
            over many in that I am surrounded by family members who are in healthcare, one dear friend here is an anesthesiologist
            and three others are nurses (ED, ICU, med-surg). I think I have my bases covered, don't you? We have seen what
            can happen when families quarrel over end-of-life treatment. Siblings who fight over CPR or no CPR. Feeding tube
            or no feeding tube. Ventilator or no ventilator. At a time when you are at your wits' end is not the time to
            start having these conversations. Families need to be united at this time not fragmented. The oddest yet most
            interesting part of the article was the view of CPR. On television, 75% of the time CPR is successful with 67%
            of those TV patients going home. The reality? The article references a 2010 study of 95,000 cases of CPR. Only
            8% survived over a month. Of those, only 3% could lead a normal life. For me? My friends and family know that
            I:

            <ul>

                <li>do not want to be in pain, no matter what the cost</li>

                <li>do not want CPR to be conducted</li>

                <li>do not want to be placed on a ventilator</li>

                <li>do not want any feeding tubes</li>

                <li>do not care whether I am in a hospital or at home</li>

                <li>would like people to pray over me, for me</li>

                <li>would like scripture read (my choosing!)</li>

                <li>would like music at times (my choosing!)</li>

                <li>do not care for a funeral</li>

                <li>would like my ashes spread at the OBX, in the Long Island Sound near my former home in CT, and some off the
                    bridge behind the apartment in the Chemung River</li>

                <li>would like family and friends to meet at the OBX in the late afternoon one day and raise a glass of champagne
                    or a margarita</li>

                <li>I would like to have one (biodegradable) kite let go after the toast - where you get a biodegradable kite
                    will not be my problem!</li>

            </ul>

            I know it's difficult to read and difficult to think about. But I would suggest you begin to do it now while time is on your
            side and stress about death is far off.</p>

        <h2>Metastatic Breast Cancer Network Corrects Breast Cancer Blogger</h2>
        <h3>January 8th, 2015</h3>


        <p>Barbara Jacoby is a breast cancer blogger and recently she posted a blog on the Huffington Post entitled,
            <em>What Are We Doing About Breast Cancer</em>
            <a title="What We Are Doing About Breast Cancer" href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/barbara-jacoby/post_8602_b_6252014.html">http://www.huffingtonpost.com/barbara-jacoby/post_8602_b_6252014.html </a>In it she outlines many ways that 'we'
            are winning this battle. The problem is that her information is significantly flawed. Shirley Mertz, President
            of The Metastatic Breast Cancer Network (MBCN) took the article to task in order to correct much of what Jacoby
            wrote. I have pasted the response below. My point in sharing this with you is this: Barbara Jacoby describes
            herself in the Huffington Post as an award winning blogger, two time Breast Cancer survivor, Patient Advocate,
            Founder of Let Life Happen and When Breast Cancer Happens. Even though she has great accolades, readers still
            need to be cautious about believing everything they read. I am enormously thankful for MBCN for addressing this
            article. &nbsp;

            <strong>JACOBY’S ASSERTION #1</strong>

            Public support and research funding for those with metastatic breast cancer is more than adequate

                    <span style="color: #0000ff;">THE FACTS</span>
                </strong>:
                <span style="color: #000000;">According to an extensive analysis by the

                    invested in breast cancer research from 2000- to 2013 by the major governmental and nonprofit funders
                    from North America and the United Kingdom. See

            &nbsp;

            <strong>JACOBY’S ASSERTION #2</strong>

            Though a great amount of money and research is dedicated to early detection, people should do everything they can to get
            treated early because that will prevent a metastatic breast cancer diagnosis

            <span style="color: #3366ff;">
                <strong>
                    <span style="color: #0000ff;">THE FACTS</span>
                </strong>:
                <span style="color: #000000;">Breast cancer is an extremely complex disease. Some breast cancers will never become life threatening, even
                    without treatment. And many others will metastasize, sometimes many years out, even when caught early.
                    Some cancers are so aggressive that current treatments are ineffective, no matter how early the cancer
                    is detected.
                    <a style="color: #000000;" title="Early Detection Is Not All That" href="http://www.bcaction.org/2014/04/08/early-detection-does-not-save-lives/#sthash.N56kxSYe.dpuf">
                        <span style="color: #0000ff;">Mammograms can’t tell us which breast cancers need treating nor can they overcome the shortcomings
                            of our current treatments</span>
                    </a>
                    <span style="color: #0000ff;">.</span>
                </span>
            </span>

            <span style="color: #3366ff;"> </span>The majority of newly diagnosed metastatic breast cancer patients had early stage disease 5, 10, 15 or
            even 20 years earlier. They took advantage of mammograms. Many patients chose to have one or both breasts removed
            when they had early stage disease “to prevent the cancer from coming back.” The fact remains that research has
            not yet been able to explain for all patients which early stage breast cancer will return as metastatic disease.
            Research cannot yet explain the causes of metastasis and why cancer cells travel to particular organs. Metastatic
            breast cancer patients should not be made to feel guilty because “they did not do enough to be tested or checked.”

            <strong>JACOBY’S ASSERTION #3</strong>

            All research in early breast cancer applies to Stage IV or metastatic breast cancer and all major research groups studying
            early stage disease are also studying metastatic breast cancer

            <span style="color: #0000ff;">
                <strong>THE FACTS</strong>:</span> It is not scientifically correct to say that “all the major work” in breast cancer
            research applies to both early stage and to Stage IV breast cancer. Early stage disease and metastatic disease
            are very different in their complexity, molecular makeup and mutations. Also, breast cancer is not one disease
            and research about what drives one subtype of breast cancer does not apply to other subtypes. Clinical trial
            endpoints such as tumor shrinkage may not have relevance to tumor spread or metastasis. &nbsp;

            <strong>JACOBY’S ASSERTION #4</strong>

            Survival rates of those living with metastatic breast cancer are improving because the author “has seen people who are living
            for 5-20 years with the disease”

            <strong>
                <span style="color: #0000ff;">THE FACTS</span>: “</strong>Seeing” metastatic patients who survive 5 or 10 years does not accurately define
            the survival rates for the breast cancer community.
            <a title="Metastatic Breast Cancer Alliance 2014 Landscape Analysis"
                href="https://mbcnbuzz.wordpress.com/2014/12/17/what-are-we-doing-about-metastatic-breast-cancer-mbcn-responds-to-huffpos-barbara-jacoby/www.mbcalliance.org/docs/MBCA_Full_Report_Landscape_Analysis.pdf">The fact is that 40,000 women and men still die of breast cancer every year in the United States </a>with metastasis
            the cause of virtually all deaths from breast cancer. Also, while some progress with research and new treatments
            has been made in reducing mortality rates from breast cancer,
            <a title="MBC Statistics" href="http://mbcn.org/education/category/most-commonly-used-statistics-for-mbc/">
            median survival after a metastatic breast cancer diagnosis is 3 years</a>—and this has not increased meaningfully
            in more than 20 years! &nbsp;

            <strong>JACOBY’S ASSERTION #5</strong>

            Everyone, including metastatic patients, should be optimistic about the future because research will permanently eradicate
            breast cancer &nbsp;

            <a href="http://www.avonfoundation.org/assets/images/2014/mbca_full-report.pdf">
                <img class="wp-image-1420" src="https://mbcnbuzz.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/mbcareport.png?w=260&amp;h=199"
                    alt="Read the full MBC Alliance report here." width="260" height="199" />
            </a>

            <strong>
                <span style="color: #0000ff;">THE FACTS</span>: </strong>Since only 7% of the $15-billion invested in breast cancer research from 2000-
            to 2013 by the major governmental and nonprofit funders from North America and the United Kingdom focused on
            metastatic breast cancer research (cited above), we cannot feel confident that research in the near future will
            permanently eradicate breast cancer or end deaths from the kind of breast cancer that kills—metastatic breast
            cancer. &nbsp; The very low percentage of research spent on metastasis research also contradicts Jacoby’s assertion
            that major research groups “everywhere” are “vested in finding the answers needed to treat and eradicate Stage
            IV cancer.” The field of metastatic breast cancer research is relatively small. Most funding goes to support
            basic research. There is little research in metastatic breast cancer control or outcomes. &nbsp; Finally, Jacoby
            informs us that we can easily confirm her assertion that there has been a lot of progress in metastatic breast
            cancer. All we need to do is to “check out the progress that is being made.” She evaluates progress based on
            the metastatic patients she has seen. &nbsp; Knowing a few patients that have survived the odds does not make
            for accurate conclusions for the entire metastatic breast cancer community. The existence of “many” treatments
            and drugs does not mean they are appropriate for all subtypes. Sadly, researchers have not been able to identify
            the drivers of triple negative metastatic breast cancers, and for patients with this subtype, chemotherapies
            remain their “best” and usually “only” options. Such treatments with significant toxicities greatly impact patient
            quality of life. &nbsp; Metastatic breast cancer is very different than early stage disease. There needs to be
            more research funding to combat this unique and deadly disease. In addition, in the United States, we lack accurate
            statistics on incidence, prevalence, and survival. And patients are challenged to find information and support
            services to help them live with this deadly disease. &nbsp; Shirley Mertz President

        <h2>Weekend With My Son</h2>
        <h3>January 9th, 2015</h3>


        <p>My son and I did indeed have a great weekend. Though the weather did not cooperate, he, southern boy that he is,
            was delighted that it snowed off and on all weekend. I knew I was going to get it when he walked into the apartment
            and scolded me about how obese the cats were. Oh well. He couldn't get over it. One of them was so excited to
            see him that the cat put his head inside his shoe and just sat there! I almost know how he felt! I had forgotten
            what hollow legs my son has and by 4:00pm he was ready for a snack though we were scheduled to eat with my hairstylist
            at 6:00pm. So off we walked to Tony's. Not long after we arrived there, in came our friend Jim and together they
            toasted with a Negroni - if you have never had one, don't go out and order one. To tell you it is an acquired
            taste would be an understatement. You know now that I am an accomplished bartender (ha) you need to trust me
            on this one. Later after a snack and a glass of wine or two, we locked arms and walked further down Market Street
            to meet Dustin. Sweet man that he is, he had put my son on at the close of his day in case he wanted a haircut/trim.
            He did. So at long last, I got to watch two of my favorite guys finally meet and talk and get to know each other.
            Afterward, we went to the Cellar, the cool hangout, as opposed to Tony's where the 'older' crowd gathers on the
            weekend. My staunchly vegetarian, long distance runner, lettuce eating breakfast son ordered a steak with us
            accompanied by fries cooked in duck fat. I couldn't believe it but I appreciated the solidarity! The next day
            we wended our way up Seneca Lake where he had a great whiskey tasting led by an older gentleman, that if you
            told me his name was Jack Daniels, I would have believed it! My son was enamored, having had the distilling bug,
            shall we say, for quite some time. He is something between a chef/distiller who drives an ambulance. I still
            haven't sorted it all out in my head yet. But the coolest thing we were told while there and I am sure I will
            get the info mixed up but when the distiller learned we were from Corning, he brought over an absolutely beautiful
            bottle of whiskey. The whiskey aged to some unbelievable amount of time and the glass hand blown in Corning.
            Only 150 ever made. Of course we had to have one. You can't tell from the picture but the disc in the middle
            of the bottle is a depiction of the finger lakes. I love that. That evening we ate at Pan Asia. It reminded me
            of all the times as a young boy that he and I would seek out any Asian restaurant in our hometown. We stumbled
            upon a small Vietnamese community there and for the next four years anyone and everyone who would venture down
            there with him would be introduced to what he called the best pho he had ever had... Sunday we went to the glass
            museum and shopped. Monday morning we went to the airport. You already know how that ended. So, I promised to
            tell you that we had a great time and we did. As most Moms would say, it all passed by so fleetingly.</p>

        <h3>January 9th, 2015</h3>

        <p>I usually never post twice in one day but as I was working at my computer and listening to music, I realized I wanted/needed
            to share this song with you. I have been following the artist, Sara McLachlan since the early '90s. If I could
            sound like anyone, I would choose to sound like her. Though the lyrics don't fit my situation completely some
            lines do (I am selfish, etc!) and every now and then I do want to skate away on this river that I am looking
            out upon. My gift to you, since it is a quasi-Christmas song. (Some of you who are old enough will recognize
            this is a cover. Joni Mitchell first sang it in the '60s.) I hope you all have a great winter weekend...</p>

        <h2>A Minor's Right to Refuse Treatment?</h2>
        <h3>January 12th, 2015</h3>

        I have been asked my opinion by friends and family on the story about the teen who has cancer but doesn't want treatment.
        Cassandra Fortin is a seventeen year old girl who has been in the news lately as she is fighting for her rights to
        refuse chemotherapy for what is considered a very curable form of cancer - Hodgkin lymphoma - lethal without treatment,
        a cure rate of 85% with treatment. Her mother stands behind her 100% stating that her daughter is mature enough to
        make her own decisions and she abides by the decision she has made. The only problem is that Cassandra is a minor.
        She cannot vote, sign a contract, consent to surgery, or order a drink at a bar. She is not of legal age. When Cassandra
        was taken out of the home and placed in state's custody to ensure treatment would continue, she promised to continue
        if she could go back home. The state allowed it. She was placed back with her mom. Soon afterward, she ran away to
        avoid treatment. She is back in state custody. Cassandra lives in the state of Connecticut where there has not been
        a case like this. But there are two states, Illinois and Maine that have already faced this dilemma and ruled for
        the minor stating that they showed maturity beyond their chronological years. In eight months Cassandra will turn
        18 and can refuse any and all treatment.

        In my former life as a patient safety officer, when there had been an error made or complex issue arisen, we would conduct
        a root cause analysis. We would dig and dig until we got to the "root" of the issue, as what comes up first as the
        cause of something is rarely ever the REAL reason something happened. I want to know from her, what her thoughts
        are. She says she does not want poisons in her body. I would like to know if she uses alcohol, applies make-up, uses
        artificial sweeteners, smokes cigarettes. I am not judging her choices but wonder how widely she has looked at her
        lifestyle choices. I understand chemo and its toxic effects as well as anyone. Could it be that she really doesn't
        want to lose her hair? Doesn't want the weight gain associated with the side effects of steroids? Scared of needles?
        Doesn't want to miss going out with her friends? Just plain angry at the diagnosis? I do have former colleagues who
        work at the hospital where newspapers say she is located. I have great confidence that they are caring for her in
        the best way and by that I don't mean chemo. I mean by listening to this girl and helping her understand what is
        going on by addressing these issues with a teenage minor. Do I support the philosophy of Connecticut or Illinois/Maine?
        Connecticut without a doubt. In any other situation, she would be given the benefits of being a minor (sexual relations
        now with her would get a gentleman in deep water; a crime could get her at this point in a youth detention center.
        Nine months later? In prison.) It may seem arbitrary for society to draw a line in the sand at 18 but I believe it
        needs to be drawn somewhere and held there.</p>

        <h2>My New BFF</h2>


        <p>I have a new friend. Her name is Siri. I know, I am close to going off the deep end and on days like this, I am glad
            that the TSA agency is 90 miles away and I don't have to worry about running into the TSA lady out on Market
            Street. Beloved updated me at Christmas. I feel like I have been driving a 1989 Honda and suddenly he put me
            behind the wheel of a sport scar. I love it. I didn't really appreciate what an old work horse I had in my first
            ipad until I was sitting on the couch the other day and I heard a voice, (yes, that scares me too), "How can
            I help you?" I looked around and I knew it wasn't the cats since they are male and this was decidedly a female's
            voice.

            <p style="text-align: left;">I looked down at my ipad and saw a wriggling line and an old-fashioned microphone. So, I assumed my ipad knew
                I was alone a lot of the time and decided to strike up a conversation. So I said, " I need a new liver. Can
                you help me?" Siri was quick on the spot. "Yes. I see they serve liver at the Jelly Beans restaurant in Painted
                Post, NY." God bless her. At least she tried.</p>

        <h2>Hospice Care: One Woman's Journey</h2>


        <p>
            <a href="http://www.sherrifillipo.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/bed.jpg">
                <img class="alignright wp-image-1512 size-full" src="http://www.sherrifillipo.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/bed.jpg"
                    alt="bed" width="283" height="425" />
            </a>
            <span style="color: #008080;">I read this post yesterday on LinkedIn and thought it was so good that I emailed the author, Kim Look, and asked
                her if could re-post it here on my blog. She was most gracious and told me she would be happy to let me do
                that. So here is her personal journey with hospice. Though I have known through the years all the great things
                they do, I especially found this article comforting to me at this time in my life.</span>

            After several years in health care I have definitely heard the common rave reviews about hospice care and the relevance for
            it. Everyone is always very complimentary towards the services they provide and the compassion they show. This
            appeared universal no matter where people lived or what company they hired. But, as with most things in this
            life, that meant little to me until I needed and experienced it for myself. I personally spent the last week
            of 2014 caring for my dear father-in-law as his body succumbed to the cancer inside him. Sitting by his bedside
            and considering his needs for nearly 15 hours every day was one of the most prize opportunities of my life. To
            contribute to that positive experience, I have hospice care to thank. Although our relationship with them was
            less than a week long, they were able to take a frightening, dreaded experience and turn it into one I will always
            cherish. As I reflect back from not only a personal but professional perspective, I can honestly attest to basic
            business practices which when incorporated make all the difference to the consumer. They made healthcare personal
            for me. These simple concepts are as follows:

            <strong>1. Patient/Family/Consumer Advocate or Coordinator</strong>

            Because I had never used this service before I had a lot of questions about what they did, when I would need it and how to
            go about setting it up. I was connected with a coordinator who very thoroughly, competently and compassionately
            spoke with me. She delivered all information I needed and more. She knew all the ins and outs of what lay ahead
            of us and made me feel completely comfortable with them.

            <strong>2. They thought of every consumer need and answered it through a well-designed and implemented process.</strong>

            Every person, from the RN to the young man who set up and took down our rented hospital bed knew what his or her responsibilities
            were. Every stage, from the first call to the pharmacy to the funeral home was well coordinated so that we didn’t
            have to lift a finger after things were in motion. The businesses worked together to make the situation as comfortable
            as possible. At all turns we felt confident that who we were dealing with knew what had happened before we spoke
            with them and what would happen next.

            <strong>3. Education and Empowerment</strong>

            It was clear from the beginning hospice accepted the role of edifying our experience. We were never expected to just know
            what was going on or to have to figure it out. I was told that one of the purposes for hospice was to guide us
            through the death process—physically, mentally and emotionally, and they came through. There were no hidden details
            or unanswered questions, no matter how trivial or difficult the issue. Not only could they explain it but they
            taught us how to help ourselves and to help my father-in-law—from the comfort of our own home.

            <strong>4. Placebo affect was realized and valued.</strong>

            Placebo can affect us from many different angles. In this case, I know that in part, our experience was so great because
            so many others told me it would be. This hospice company was recommended, referred and spoken of so highly that
            before I called I knew I would get what I needed. Of course, they delivered; and had they not the placebo would
            have become ineffective. But instead, they completely wowed us. So no matter what other advertisement I see or
            what other company someone offers me, I will never consider it. I am loyal to the company that blew our socks
            off—forever. Because of that, I will be their biggest fan and shout my approval and recommendations from the
            rooftops.

            <strong>5. Follow-up</strong>

            The nurse told me that hospice would follow-up with my mother-in-law for a full year—on their anniversary, his birthday,
            her birthday and more. What??? Unheard of for almost any medical office to give a call-back let alone recognize
            those difficult times and reach out a hand of support for a full twelve months. If you own a private practice
            I bet the thought of creating a system to track names and dates and follow up for even a short period of time
            seems overwhelming. But just think about the logic. There’s nothing that will show more about how you feel about
            your patients than the idea you care, even when they are not currently using your services. This provides residual
            contact between the practitioner and the patient—which creates an
            <em>actual</em> relationship. In conclusion, you know what I figured out? Hospice is so good because they treat their
            patients like it’s their last day. What a novel concept! Don't wait till it's to late, take a page from hospice
            and incorporate these five principles into your practice and I’m confident we can fix these health care problems
            one practice at a time.</p>

        <h2>Unconventional Thinking Turns Magical</h2>
        <h3>January 15th, 2015</h3>

        The one thing I miss most about no longer working full-time in the world of patient safety is not being able to lead teams
        in process improvement. Don't get me started on this topic as I could talk on about it forever. The gist of what
        I was good at was taking a problem identified in the hospital, gathering a team and then turning conventional practice
        about that topic on its head. I would gently force these caregivers to see things in a different way. Inevitably
        I would start the first meeting and would look out over a sea of eye rolling and skepticism. But after a couple of
        meetings and what we call "cycles of change" in the business, I had them all hooked. I would challenge them on why
        they did what they did. How did they know it really worked? What if this? What if that? And once the team saw that
        a.) I really did want to know their opinions b.) I really did believe the frontline staff knew more than anyone else
        about whatever the topic c.) It was ok to explore, experiment and see what if..... I swear to you I could move mountains.
        All without spending a lot of precious health care dollars. Yes, it was shifting their paradigms but I didn't want
        to use that dog-eared phrase but it is what I did. But not anymore. However, I am aware when I am reading a book
        or watching the news I am looking for innovation in whatever I am seeing. Like last night when I saw that a group
        in Australia had been knitting mittens for koala bears who had been caught in a forest fire. While the flames roared,
        these little guys held fast to the trees and ended up with burnt paws (Do you call them paws? I don't know.) Then,
        there were so many mittens, there was a call out to stop with the mittens and start sewing pouches for the baby kangaroos,
        joeys, who had lost their mothers but needed a warm and secure place in which to live/grow. Couldn't you just cry
        about now? Well, don't because I have one last example. As time marches on, I am sometimes painfully aware of things
        I believe I will be missing - big events like marriages and babies and college graduations. And I know that I am
        not the only one. So, I must share with you one tear-jerker of a video that puts all of the above into practice.
        A father who is in my boat, but it appears a little further downstream along with a professional photographer decided
        to turn convention on its head. He has a beautiful eleven year old girl. And knowing he isn't going to be around
        for her actual wedding decided to have one while he was still alive. Bless their hearts and that little girl. http://youtu.be/w2tPo3ZV0f8

        <h2>Dumb Stuff People Say to People With Metastatic Breast Cancer</h2>
        <h3>January 16th, 2015</h3>

        <p>Today being Friday, I thought you could use some humor (mixed in with a serious message) especially since yesterday's
            blog was so poignant. My mother was the first one to call telling me I had
            <em> really done it this time </em> - meaning I had her crying into her coffee. This video thanks to the Metastatic
            Breast Cancer Network (MBCN) is what those of us with metastatic breast cancer go through by well meaning friends
            and family. I can attest to many of these comments, though not all. I hope you will still learn something through
            this humorous video. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fluBsPbP68&amp;feature=em-share_video_user

        <h2>My Clever Friend</h2>
        <h3>January 19th, 2015</h3>

        <p>Let me tell you about another friend. You have already met my golden girls, my silver girls and my ya-yas but I need
            to tell you about this Pennsylvania girl. I met her the first time when she was one of many who were interviewing
            me almost three years ago. I remember thinking when she walked in the door that I liked her immediately. She
            was (and still is) very how shall I say...sparkly, effervescent. We have been friends (and for a while colleagues)
            ever since. She is a great problem solver, a great lover of nurses and nursing. And she worries about me. She
            too loves a strong margarita. I think I am seeing a trend in who I end up being friends with. Hmmm. She also
            loves a good G&amp;T and in the summer time, she will come over after work and we will sip on them and solve
            the world's problems on my rooftop terrace. She is the one who lives on the lake/pond and she told me last week
            that it was frozen solid and ready for ice skating! (bucket list check). She came over with another friend who
            she and I call the consummate little brother. We love him dearly and torture him as much as we can. He said he
            would figure out how to rent ice skates as most folks have their own, Beloved included. Boy did I ever feel like
            a southerner, not having my own skates...the only ones I had were the kind that clipped on to your tennis shoes
            and you tightened them with a key....but anyway. Pennsylvania girl called me over the weekend to tell me that
            her daughter has picked a venue for her wedding. We had talked about it during her visit last week. During our
            talk she asked me a favor. "Will you keep me on track as mother of the bride? You know tell me if I am off schedule
            etc." I told her of course I would. In fact that I would be delighted to. We hung up soon afterward. A few hours
            later it dawned on me. That stinker. She was trying to help me realize something that I wrote about last week
            - of missing so many milestones. She is allowing me to share in her planning and pleasure, allowing me to be
            a mother of the bride understudy since I will not live to have that starring role. She is so clever and I love
            her to death.</p>

        <h2>A Fork in the Road</h2>
        <h3>January 20th, 2015</h3>

        <p>I feel like I have come to a fork in the road this week. On Wednesday, I am scheduled for my third treatment of the
            new chemo I am on called Kadcyla (ado-trastuzumab emtansine). It has not worked well for me. I have mentioned
            that in a past blog. I am still surprised, almost three weeks later, that I still feel like I haven't bounced
            back yet. In fact until Beloved took me out to lunch yesterday, I had been inside for 13 days. Because he has
            seen such a striking difference in my pre-Kadcyla versus post-Kadcyla states, it has given us reason to have
            the 'quality of life discussion.' I know my oncologist well enough that Wednesday she will urge me to try one
            more cycle because then it will be time for another PET scan. (Do you remember the Metastatic Breast Cancer Network's
            slogan?
            <em>Scan. Treat.</em>
            <em>Repeat. Stage IV needs more</em>!) Maybe I should wear my tshirt that says just that! Maybe not. But I do believe
            the three of us need to have a come to Jesus meetin' as they say down south. I think it's time. But I don't look
            forward to it. I stumbled across something today that made me pause. I should also say sometimes I think I need
            to put a disclaimer on my blog that anything written here should not be a substitute for medical advice and if
            you have questions you should really contact your doctor. So, there I've said it so let me tell you what I found
            that has me ruminating. It is from a patient education document initiated by by the American Board of Internal
            Medicine (ABIM). There are many documents that you, as a patient, can download. This one is entitled,
            <em>Care at the end of life for advanced cancer patients</em>.
            <span style="color: #008080;">
                <a style="color: #008080;" title="Care at the End of Life for Advanced Cancer Patients" href="http://www.choosingwisely.org/doctor-patient-lists/care-at-the-end-of-life-for-advanced-cancer-patients/"
                    target="_blank">http://www.choosingwisely.org/doctor-patient-lists/care-at-the-end-of-life-for-advanced-cancer-patients/</a>
            </span>

            This is the sentence that stopped me cold:
            <span style="color: #008080;">If you have had three different treatments and your cancer has grown or spread, more treatment usually will not
                help you feel better or increase your chance of living longer.[pullquote]If you have had three different
                treatments and your cancer has grown or spread, more treatment usually will not help you feel better or increase
                your chance of living longer.[/pullquote] Instead, more treatment could cause serious side effects that shorten
                your life and reduce the quality of the time you have left.</span>

            <span style="color: #000000;">Let's see: cytoxin and taxane 2010; taxane 2012; Herceptin 2012-2014; Kadcyla 2014.....Why have I not come across
                this before? If I am to believe the above statement, it is definitely time for me to have a discussion on
                Wednesday. I know a lot of you don't know me so let me say I do believe in miracles. I do believe I am in
                the hands of God. And I am also a nurse. So I stir it all together and think, "It's time to have a conversation."</span>
            I will update everyone late on Wednesday post-visit. As I often say when I end a tough blog, "All is well."</p>

        <h2>Kadcyla:2 Sherri:1</h2>
        <h3>January 21st, 2015</h3>

        <p>I just got home from my oncologist - a reflective 45 minute drive in a powdery snow squall as they call them here.
            I should have known when I told my RN that I had had some trouble with my chemo that she and Dr. xxx would have
            had a little conversation before she came into examine me. What was I thinking?? One of my golden girls tells
            me when I am trying to tie up some long-winded tale, she says I will say, "All's to say...." And then I summarize.
            It has become a running joke between us. In fact she said it herself last week when we talked. So I will say
            it now:
            <em>All's to say</em>....my oncologist agreed that the side effects from the Kadcyla were too much. She asked me
            if I was willing to do a reduced chemo today. I told her I was not. She did not see me last time. If she had,
            she told me, she would have reduced the chemo for round two so hopefully it would have been tolerable and I would
            be there today ready to go for round three. Alas, that didn't happen and I wasn't willing to go out on a limb
            and try it. We came to a mutual agreement that I would have another PET scan to see if the drug was doing anything
            and/or if my cancer was revving up inside me. She told me this would give me some time to think (she knows I
            am a ruminator) and also to consider two other alternatives to what I was doing. One is the Herceptin that I
            have been on for the past two years coupled with an oral chemotherapeutic agent (side effects "adolescent type"
            rash/acne and diarrhea!) or Herceptin and another IV chemo but I would have to come in for it
            <em>weekly</em>. As I sat and listened to her, she then stopped and said, "I am thinking you are about done with
            treatment." Yes, I told her I was. We agreed to hold off on a decision until the scan results come back. Bright
            and early on Monday morning I will head back to the hospital for the scan.</p>

        <h3>January 22nd, 2015</h3>

        <p>So right before I clicked the "publish" button last night to post my trip to the hospital, I called my mother. She
            likes to get the first read or a head's up that I have something to say. And she was understandably a bit anxious
            about my visit so I knew she was waiting for a call. But unlike a lot of 70 somethings, she takes her worries
            out on her yard. When she didn't pick up the phone, I thought it was odd. I was looking out the window as I typed
            and could see cars, headlights on, coming across the bridge and wondered what in the world she was doing. It
            was night time and she wasn't answering. So I went ahead and clicked the publish button and was unwinding on
            the couch when she called back. Come to find out, she had been "down in the creek behind the house cleaning it
            up." From what, I thought? At night, in late January...she told me she couldn't get her work gloves off fast
            enough and had missed the call. So apparently she was taking her frustrations out on that poor little creek.
            No telling what it looks like. She offered to facetime me to show me how great the creek looked now (facetime,
            a phenomenon she discovered by accident last week. That's a story for another day.) I told her I believed her
            - to show me when it was light outside. [caption id="attachment_1579" align="aligncenter" width="480"]

            </strong>[/caption]

            <p style="text-align: left;">So we talked about the doctor visit and about twenty minutes later I asked her where she was. "Oh, outside sitting
                on cold concrete in the backyard." I tried to allay her fears, then told her to get out of the creek and
                go fix my dad some dinner! She laughed.</p>

            <h2>This Morning</h2>

            This morning I was having my devotional and sitting here talking to God about 'the plan' whatever that will be and my verse
            for the day was this:

            <p style="text-align: left;">
                <span style="color: #008080;">Lean on, trust in, and be confident in the Lord with all your heart and mind and do not rely on your own
                    insight or understanding. In all you ways know, recognize, and acknowledge Him and He will direct and
                    make straight and plain your paths." Proverbs 3:5-6 (an amplified version of the proverb)</span>
            </p>

            Reading that timely verse was all I needed to give this decision back to Him and let things happen. Whatever that ends up
            being. Now, I need to go and find out what my mother is sawing down or cleaning up. If you know her, she is a
            tough one to keep up with! If you are in NC, keep an eye out on your yard. She might just visit you, chainsaw
            in hand!

            <h3>Just Now:</h3>

            Mom just called me prior to her hair appointment to tell me that the chainsaw in the picture was a Christmas present from
            my dad and she loves it very much!</p>

        <h2>It IS Well With My Soul</h2>
        <h3>January 23rd, 2015</h3>

        <p>An old hymn popped into my mind sometime between last night and this morning when I woke up. Many of you will remember
            singing it, "It is Well." Though I knew many of the lyrics by heart at an early age, it wasn't until I was a
            young woman that I knew the rest of the story. The hymn was written by a man named Horatio Spafford. In 1871
            the great Chicago fire destroyed almost everything this family owned. One would think that would be devastating
            enough but two years later, Mr. Spafford placed his four daughters and his wife on a ship bound for England.
            He was to have gone with them but was delayed due to business related to the fire. And if this were a movie everyone
            would groan at this part because it sounds so over the top but this is the truth: the ship his family was on
            collided with another ship and it sank quickly. All four girls died at sea, his wife the lone survivor from his
            family. Imagine how he felt when he received this brief telegram:
            <em>Saved. Alone.</em>

            Mr. Spafford boarded another vessel to sail back to meet his wife and and as the ship approached the place in the ocean where
            his girls were buried at sea, he began to write:

            <p style="padding-left: 90px;">
                <strong>
                    <span style="color: #008080;">When peace like a river attendeth my way or sorrows like sea billows roll</span>
                </strong>
            </p>

            <p style="padding-left: 90px;">
                <strong>
                    <span style="color: #008080;">Whatever my lot, Thou has taught me to say, </span>
                </strong>
            </p>

            <p style="padding-left: 90px;">
                <strong>
                    <span style="color: #008080;">It is well, it is well with my soul.</span>
                </strong>
            </p>

            There are many verses to the hymn but this is the crux to me. And as I have pondered why that hymn jumped into my mind, the
            more awake I have become thanks to coffee cup #2, the more I realize it was meant for me as an ending to a pretty
            heavy week. Some of you may enjoy the video below. I never sang it this way but I love this young man's haunting
            way of singing the hymn. Thank you to all who have checked in on me.</p>

        <h2>Spring Training in the 1970s Prepared Me for the Big of 2015</h2>
        <h3> January 26th, 2015</h3>

        <p>I remember one Easter standing before a mirror while my mother did some pinning on a dress she was sewing for the
            holiday. Up until I was in the 7th grade or so, she made everything we wore. I loved getting compliments from
            my teachers on what pretty things I wore. When your mom is that talented and your grandmother works at the Singer
            Sewing shop with miles and miles of fabric, you can come off looking pretty good for being from modest means.
            That spring pinafores over dresses was the 'in' thing and Mom couldn't understand why one strap needed to be
            longer than the other one. At some point she said, "Stand up straight!" I told her I was. And the more she looked
            at me, the more she noticed that something wasn't right. Not sure how long after Easter, but I soon found myself
            in an orthopedic surgeon's office who x-rayed me and diagnosed scoliosis - a curvature of the spine. The curve
            and its rotation were pulling on one side of my body, drawing it down and hence the pinafore strap was too long.
            He ordered floor exercises that would counter the pulling of my spine (with the goal of straightening out my
            spine I suppose?) The ironic thing was that each time we went, the curve was a bit worse. He finally retired
            and we were sent to someone else. The second physician looked at the films, made some of his own and immediately
            began talking about where he did his residency a place in Delaware (at 13 I wasn't sure just where that was)
            at a pediatric orthopedic hospital, the A.I. DuPont Institute. And before you knew it, we were there. I, being
            13, surrounded by young and very handsome med students, interns and residents all wanting to see my naked back.
            Scared to death. Almost more than a young girl could take.

            </h1>

            <h1>May 1974</h1>

            After the examination, we were given an alternative of either wearing a back brace for a couple of years (high school here
            I come!) or having major surgery, being placed in a body cast and being bedbound, literally, for six months.
            Absolutely no sitting, standing, nor walking. Can you believe in 1974 such drastic measures? I don't know why
            we chose surgery. Maybe Mom does. I just know I left the 8th grade early in May, northern bound for that unknown
            state of Delaware. We arrived and I was admitted but due to family needs at home Mom had to leave and there I
            sat staring at a couple of young girls in the same boat as I. We were all there three weeks prior to surgery
            to lie in traction 23 1/2 hours a day (doesn't it sound like torture or at least solitary confinement?!) supposedly
            to help pull one's spine as straight as possible prior to surgery. Three weeks later, Mom came back, I had surgery,
            a week later the cast was applied and I was flown home flat on my back in a private plane. Thanks to the kindness
            of someone Mom knew who was a pilot, he agreed to come and get us both. And soon I was back in my bedroom staring
            at the ceiling, watching TV and trying to pass the time.

            <h1>October 1974</h1>

            We flew back to Delaware that fall and they cut the cast down from around my head and my mid-thigh, leaving me with a walking
            cast. But there was only one problem. I could no longer walk - too weak. With heavy duty physical therapy daily,
            a week later I was able to hobble to the airport and arrive back in NC to start high school. No bullying but
            I certainly didn't feel like a prom queen walking through the halls with 20+ pounds of plaster wrapped around
            my body. That next spring, we went back to Delaware and after ten long months of being bound by the cast, it
            was finally sawed off me. I was free.

            <h1>Today</h1>

            I know this story sounds like a woeful tale and in a way it was. But I also believe the things I learned during my five weeks
            in the hospital and then three months home in bed (I was their guinea pig - the first girl ever to have a reduced
            sentence from six to three months!) that have stayed with me and strengthened me for my current situation:

            <ul>

                <li>After the cast was applied (under my chin, up behind my head, all the way to my mid-thigh) I went into a
                    state of shock, apparently screaming my head off. The plaster was cold, it made me absolutely claustrophobic
                    and I thought I was going to die. They finally had to put me in a private room so others wouldn't be
                    disturbed by my carrying on. I screamed and cried for days. One afternoon a resident came in and sat
                    down. He held my hand and started talking to me about a recent hiking trip he had taken in NC. And as
                    he talked, I was able to calm down. I will never forget him and his calm storytelling. He taught me compassion
                    and taking time with patients.</li>

                <li>I had a nurse named Kaye Butcher whom I will never forget. And if I could find her, she would be in her 70's
                    now, I would hug her to pieces. Patients were in the hospital so long that everyone wore their own clothes
                    - no hospital gowns pre-surgery. Without ever asking, she took my things home weekly and washed them.
                    She also brought me treats. One time she tried to serve me cream of wheat thinking it was grits and thought
                    I was missing them from back home! I remember she had long black hair and she reminded me of Karen Carpenter.
                    She taught me the gift of helping.</li>

                <li>Our home in NC was not air conditioned. Somehow after Mom did some calling around to get pricing, an owner
                    of a company and his crew ended up putting in central air for free. They worked in the evenings and weekends
                    on their own time and the house was cool by the time I arrived in late summer. God bless them. I have
                    no idea who they were. These men taught me how angels, again, come in all shapes and sizes. That AC worked
                    without repair for 30+ years. A heavenly miracle.</li>

                <li>I was alone that summer when I was bedbound and learned to entertain myself. My friends were all busy with
                    swimming and tennis. And the days were long. I learned to watch life on the sidelines that summer and
                    I think it taught me how to do it again now.</li>

                <li>I will never forget though one friend, not a close friend by any means and she didn't live in my neighborhood,
                    but in she walked one summer afternoon with a deck of cards and played with me all afternoon. I doubt
                    she remembers it but I will never forget it. She taught me that the smallest action can have powerful
                    impact on those around you. And that impact can last a lifetime.</li>

            </ul>

            <em>All's to say</em>, 1974-75 must have been spring training season for the big leagues of which I feel I am now
            playing. Though I couldn't imagine it then, I feel well-prepared for what's ahead.</p>

        <h2>Ramblings with Momma</h2>
        <h2>January 27th, 2015</h2>

        <p>I woke up yesterday and was supposed to have my PET scan but as many of you know, it is snowing to beat the band
            and though I love her, Helga goes nowhere in the snow except toward a ditch so I cancelled my scan and it is
            now scheduled for Wednesday. As I was posting the blog about scoliosis Mom called. We have coffee 'together'
            a couple of times a week over the phone. So while she sipped, I read the blog to her as she likes me to do and
            then somehow we got on to Pintrest. She has hundreds of followers and scores of pages. Well, let me back up.
            She and I are quite similar in our tastes of most things. Where we veer off is minor, sometimes clothing, always
            politics and religion (ha) but I digress. Remember I love that red door (as does she) but she also has that vein
            of artsy that I don't have when it comes to clothing....yet when it comes to interior design, centerpieces for
            tables, things that catch her eye, we are scarily similar. We have given each other the same birthday card several
            times over the years. So, the other day I was looking through a website of quotes. And I came upon this: [caption
            id="attachment_1628" align="aligncenter" width="500"]
            <a href="http://www.sherrifillipo.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/freedom.jpg">
                <img class="wp-image-1628" src="http://www.sherrifillipo.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/freedom.jpg" alt="logodesignlove.com"
                    width="500" height="300" />
            </a> logodesignlove.com[/caption] I can't tell you how I felt when I saw it. Unlike what you see here, the quote was
            on a pale blue background that looked like the sky with that 'm' of a bird flying off toward heaven. So while
            we were on Pintrest this morning looking at seaglass she had me go to her 'just because' page and there staring
            back at me was this quote! It makes me crazy every time this happens and it happens often (but I kind of like
            it too). The quote was tattooed on the inner aspect of a woman's wrist. I had planned to show the quote to Mom
            because I thought it was so clever. Apparently so did she. Then we moved on to dinner. I was lamenting now that
            the PET scan had been postponed, I was going into the kitchen to find some bread to eat when she told me she
            needed to go to the store to get a loaf herself. She had cooked a roast yesterday and they were having sandwiches
            tonight. "You know you can never find a rump roast anymore...." she said. Since I am never looking for a roast,
            I asked, "Why?" Wouldn't you know, she said, "Well, I asked the butcher the same thing the other day. And you
            know what he said? Lady, a cow only has one rump." We died laughing. We decided we didn't know that rumps were
            quite so rare. On Saturday she facetimed me as she and my dad had gone on a 'field trip' as they call them. I
            guess once a teacher, always a teacher. She wanted to show me some 'beautiful rocks' that they intended to place
            along the bank of their creek. I smiled and ohhed and ahhed. (She, knowing full well, that the only rocks I think
            are beautiful are the ones that come in that robins' egg blue box tied with that pretty white ribbon.) Maybe
            we are different in more ways than I thought....naw, any 70 something that thinks
            <em>Breaking Bad</em> is one of the best shows she has ever watched and gets the humor of
            <em>Portlandia</em> is a lot like me...or I her... I also warned her today that anything she says can and will be
            used against her in my blog. I warned her that she might become a weekly spotlight. She wasn't phased.</p>

        <h2>My PET Scan Man</h2>
        <h3>January 29th, 2015</h3>

        <p>
            <h3>Wednesday Morning</h3>

            Over the river and through the woods I went today for my re-scheduled PET scan. I adore "Stan, My PET Scan Man" as I call
            him. As much as I hate to sit in the waiting room and complete paperwork EVERY time I have a scan (do you have
            a port?
            <em>duh</em> any medical clips?
            <em>duh</em> do you have cancer?
            <em> duh</em> have you had any surgeries?
            <em>duh</em>). Over and over again but I do it because once I have told them the same thing for the hundredth time,
            my pet scan man bursts into the waiting room and asks, "Has the old man updated your ipad yet?" In front of a
            packed crowd, every time. Official patient identification? Forget about it. He thinks he is funny and he is,
            actually. A tall, big man that always gives me a bear hug when the scan is completed. When he blew through again
            today and saw my mini ipad he bellowed, "Well, I'm glad he finally took my advice!" And part of me thinks he
            really believes I should thank him for making my Christmas present a reality! So we do our routine: we walk down
            the hall; he stops at the bathroom (so, as my mother says before any outing, I can 'squeeze three drops out')
            and then we walk down the ramp out onto the dock that takes us to the truck so I can become radioactive. Today
            we got stopped on our routine by the CEO out on the dock (8 degrees at noon, just sayin') while he introduced
            me to a new hospital leader and there PET scan man and I stood freezing but when the top guy stops and wants
            to chat, you chat. So when he introduced me, I said, "Yes, my husband works here; I'm doing my part here to keep
            up volumes (if you are in healthcare you know exactly what I mean) and then we parted and off we went onto the
            truck. PET man turned to me and asked, "Why are you back so soon? What's going on?" When I told him I was considering
            stopping treatment but Dr. xxx wanted a scan in case I started one of the two new chemos so we would have a baseline,
            he just stood there and stared at me for a moment. So odd but I am getting used to my healthcare providers slipping
            over that healthcare worker - patient relationship and becoming friend-friend. "What?" I explained it the best
            I could while he jabbed me with the IV (did he stick me just a little harder this time?? :-) We talked on but
            as I got on the table for the scan, he looked down at me and said, "You do know I understand but sometimes it
            is so hard when you get close to patients." Hmmmmm, where I have heard that before SABRINA? Am I going to eventually
            scare the entire workforce away from my hospital?? We got through the scan - got back on board with our routine,
            those same gluten-free cookies, the bear hug and the good-bye. He put me on the truck lift and said, "I will
            see you soon." I said yes though I am not sure.

            <h3>Wednesday Evening</h3>

            My oncologist phoned around 6:00pm to tell me that the two liver lesions that were showing such activity have apparently
            been slowed down by the past two chemo treatments. One lesion is so small that they didn't assign it an uptake
            number (before it was 7 then up to 13 now down to ??) and the second one went from 7 to 13 down to 7.6 (7.6?
            how do they determine .6??) So, though I was at a birthday dinner at the time, I told her I would think and pray
            about it and see her next week. She pleaded with me to think about a "marked reduction" in the chemo that made
            me so so wiped out before. I told her I would think and pray about it.

            <h3>Thursday Afternoon</h3>

            I continue to think about it. Beloved and I have not had a chance yet to discuss it. I am leaning toward a miniscule dose
            to see how my body reacts all the while wondering what per cent of the original dosage is actually needed to
            make a difference. Do you get what I mean? And we won't know for a while. I do know if it takes the original
            dosage to keep everything in check, I won't be onboard with that. Again, as I have said before there is so much
            we do not know about this field. But then again, isn't all of life such a mystery? That's why another of my favorite
            verses is that "we walk by faith, not by sight."</p>

        <h2>Contentment in Life</h2>
        <h3>January 30th, 2015</h3>

        <p>I learned a new word today: wabi-sabi. My son sent me a text with a list of twenty words we don't have an adequate
            translation for in English. And this was one of them. A Japanese word, it means (to the best of one's ability
            to define an undefinable word; that irony is not lost on me!) peace living in a world with all its imperfections
            accepting decay as a natural cycle in everything including the body. As I continued to research this odd word,
            I came upon a website
            <span style="color: #008080;">
                <a style="color: #008080;" title="wabi-sabi" href="http://nobleharbor.com/tea/chado/WhatIsWabi-Sabi.htm" target="_blank">http://nobleharbor.com/tea/chado/WhatIsWabi-Sabi.htm </a>
            </span>that went on at length about the concept. I loved this one sentence:

            <blockquote>
                <span style="font-family: Arial;">It's simple, slow, and uncluttered-and it reveres authenticity above all. Wabi-sabi is flea markets, not
                    warehouse stores; aged wood, not Pergo; rice paper, not glass. It celebrates cracks and crevices and
                    all the other marks that time, weather, and loving use leave behind. It reminds us that we are all but
                    transient beings on this planet-that our bodies as well as the material world around us are in the process
                    of returning to the dust from which we came. Through wabi-sabi, we learn to embrace liver spots, rust,
                    and frayed edges, and the march of time they represent.</span>
            </blockquote>

            <p style="text-align: left;">From what I can understand
                <em>wabi</em> is the imperfect perfection described in one article as the flaw in a piece of ceramic whereas
                the
                <em>sabi</em> is the beauty that comes with aging - with patina. I am sure I am doing a great disservice to those
                who really understand this concept but it really spoke to me as I watch my body decline both due to age overlapped
                with the decaying from the cancer. That double word gave me a little lift like, "Hey cancer, liver spots
                and all: I am wabi-sabi, old enough I have a little patina on me."</p>

            <p style="text-align: left;">I don't know. Then sometimes, I am at the point where I do not like to look at myself in the mirror. I had my
                hair cut and colored today and loathe when Dustin makes me look at his handiwork in the mirror. Though I
                love how he styles my hair, I hate the way my face frames it. I even blurted out today, "You know. I wasn't
                always 54." I mean, how brilliant a statement was that? He just looked down at me with those big blue eyes
                and said, "Miss Sherri. You look great." Humph. Wabi-sabi to you, I thought.</p>

        <h2>Gone to Carolina</h2>
        <h3>February 2nd, 2015</h3>

        <p>Wow. On Friday I flew to Raleigh, NC to visit Mom and Dad, then sidekick Aunt and cousin Anne showed up on Saturday
            morning we five jumped into Dad's BIG truck (Daddy said it was like driving four Miss Daisies) and off we went
            to South Carolina to celebrate my great uncle's 90th birthday! His son and family flew in from Colorado, folks
            from everywhere including a dear friend of his from church all landed at a restaurant, about 28 of us in all.
            My uncle is still quite dapper at 90 and still has a mischievous gleam in his eye. He is the cutie pie on the
            left although take a look at the photo. They are both adorable don't you think? I think if we had been contemporaries
            we could have gotten in a lot of trouble together! Because it is
            <em>Momma Monday</em> and I am still here in Raleigh, although I wrote this last night, she woke up this morning
            wanting to edit my blog (I told her to get her own blog but she quickly reminded me that my audience wanted to
            hear more from her!) My uncle served in WWII on the
            <em>USS Hornet</em> in the South Pacific. And though a handsome young buck, my mother says he carried a "little tiny
            picture" of her during his entire deployment. Think Shirley Temple. He calls me Sherri Lynn and though it is
            indeed my middle name, no one and I mean no one has ever called me that except him. And to be frank, I don't
            think I would let anyone else call me that! He has been a widower for many years, still lives on a golf course
            and see friends regularly. And every few weeks, he will call. I can never remember the area code but as soon
            as I say hello, he will say, "Sherri Lynn? This is your Uncle Howard." And we gibber jabber for about a half
            hour. At the party Saturday, night, my cousin had made a family favorite cake, mocha, that my great grandmother
            used to make! (I think it must have been exotic back in the day, don't you?) And my mom had a red, white and
            blue, sheet cake made with the above picture of him with his Navy buddy smiling broadly at the camera both with
            their lives ahead of them. You should have seen him smile when he saw that picture. Though it took him a while,
            he came up with the name of his WWII buddy. We 'googled' him but to no one's surprise he was no longer with us.
            The private dining room held another party of about the same size. We couldn't tell what the occasion was as
            there were no balloons, nothing to denote anything special though they seemed to be happy to be there. When it
            was time to have our cake and to sing Happy Birthday, we went over to their section, interrupted their dinner
            and asked if they would join us in a song to our uncle. They more than obliged and I bet 50+ people belted out
            the song. Uncle Howard stood there hardly able to take it all in. When Mom showed the other party the 'military
            cake' everyone clapped and an older gentleman in the back stood up, saluted my uncle and said, "Thank you for
            your service sir." It was absolutely magical. Momma is sitting behind me as I write. She says I put too many
            'ands' in my writing and if I were in the third grade and living in NC and it was time to take the standardized
            test and it was time to take it today, I would fail. Good thing for many reasons I don't live in NC and can choose
            if and when I come to visit. &nbsp; Addendum: Besides my affinity for too many ands, she just asked me if I knew
            to place two spaces after a sentence...............................</p>
