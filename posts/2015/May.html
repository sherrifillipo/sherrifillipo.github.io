    <h2>My Uncle and Hospice Care</h2>
    <h3>May 5th, 2015</h3>

    <p>It has been so long since I have blogged that some of you thought I was sick..or worse.  But I am fine. I got word a week ago that my uncle who had been diagnosed with metastatic cancer five weeks ago had begun to decline rapidly. He was placed in hospice a week ago Friday. Beloved packed my car for the summer beach trip a week early and I drove 10 hours last Tuesday to NC, staying with one of my<a title="Golden Girls" href="http://www.sherrifillipo.com/?p=888"> golden girls</a>. The next day I drove two more hours to Charlotte, NC where my uncle was spending his last few days.



I arrived around lunch and when I went in, my cousin said, "Dad, Sherri is here." And he opened up his eyes. I walked over and said hello. He had been in and out of consciousness for three days but he smiled at me and barely whispered, "Hey, Sherri." I wouldn't give a million dollars for that smile as his sons told me he had only smiled twice since he had arrived. I told him I loved him and he echoed the sentiment.



I spent the afternoon with him. My aunt and cousins left for awhile to regroup. And so I sat and watched and prayed and wondered, "So, this is what it might be like [in hospice care.] Let me tell you what I saw:

<ul>

	<li>The nursing assistant came in and lovingly talked to him asking him if he wanted his mouth cleaned. She swabbed his mouth and put balm on his lips. The way she looked into his eyes was profound.</li>

	<li>The social worker came in and we talked about me for a half hour because my aunt whom she came to see wasn't there. This woman is so gifted in what she does. I was immediately attracted to her and thought how fortunate they were to have her.</li>

	<li>Later an elderly African-American gentleman quietly knocked and came in wearing his special forces cap at a jaunty angle. He was a volunteer who came to see every veteran. He gave me useful information that I passed on to my aunt.</li>

	<li>Two nurses came in to change him and reposition him and again, they worked with such grace.</li>

</ul>

I left that evening so at peace with where he was and so impressed with the facility and its staff. I drove back to Golden Girl's house happy, sad and exhausted. My uncle died the next morning. I had made it just in time.</p>

    <h2>Ty My Delivery Guy</h2>
    <h3>May 6th, 2015</h3>

<p>The next day I was in Greensboro, NC meeting my son who was finishing up his last oral exam prior to being officially finished with his college degree. The campus is a bit rambly and I got as close as I could but was nowhere near him. I spotted an employee in a delivery van and stepped out to ask him for directions. Let me add parenthetically to say that all of this racial unrest has left me sad and unsettled and sometimes I feel like I need to tell African Americans that I wouldn't hurt them and that their lives matter and anything else I thought I could say to balm the injustices. That was a major digression. But it leads to a point. The young man that got out of the delivery van was a tall heavy built African American fellow - early 20's?

I asked him if I was anywhere near the Emergency Medicine Building. He gave me a broad smile and told me I was nowhere near. Then he said, "Follow me." And I did. We wound around the campus and he dropped me off at a non-descript building and got out talking on his walkie-talkie. He looked at me and said, "They tell me it is on the second floor." I thanked him profusely and then got this idea.

I had read about this in a book a long time ago but had never put it into place. The thought was if you go up to any one and ask them if you could pray for them, no one would say no. And I got the strongest push to do that to this young man. So I said, "I wish I could pay you for helping get through the campus. But you know what? Is there anything in your life that I could pray for?"

His eyes widened and he turned his head to the side. Then he looked down at me (he was a big guy) and said, "Would you pray for my future?" I told him absolutely. I asked him if he wanted me to do it right then or later. He said, "Later." And then he walked over to his van. He turned back and said, "My name is Ty. Please don't forget to pray."

I couldn't forget. I plan to pray for this young man forever. He smiled and drove away.</p>

    <h2>At Long Last: My Son Graduated Last Night</h2>
    <h3>May 7th, 2015</h3>

    <p>In the midst of my uncle dying and all the family conversations and things that need to be done, my son  graduated from EMS/Paramedic training last night.  Oh the prayers that have been launched from my living room and the homes of people from around the country. As we were driving around last Wednesday, he nonchalantly said, "Well, I don't guess that this can be a surprise but  I want you to pin me Wednesday night at our ceremony." I dissolved into a puddle of tears. I told him I would be honored. I was floored.

    We have come so far. You have no idea. And sentimental man that he is, he asked if I could pick up flowers that he wanted to give to one of this professors as a thank you gift for maneuvering him through this difficult program and the process. He told me that he needed to write a card for if that would say, something to the effect, "I would have picked you the entire garden, but I couldn't afford it." That is my son to a  T.

    He is my only child and I am so happy I am still alive to see this program come to fruition. Thanks be to God.</p>

    <h2>Zero, My Hero</h2>
    <h3>May 11th, 2015</h3>

    <p>I want to go back to last week, the sad week in which my uncle died. This time my angel was a cat. Let me explain. Remember I had driven 10 hours a week early so I could spend a last few minutes with my uncle who was quickly dying of cancer. In the hustle and bustle of getting me to NC and my family all pulling together, we had not ordered flowers for the funeral. Late last Friday night my mom and I looked up at one another and realized it. We googled around and found a florist very close to the church where the service was to take place. We made our online purchase and specified that we needed them delivered to the church by 9:30 that Monday morning. The order was accepted and we moved on with weekend plans.

On Sunday morning we got the strangest call. It was from the florist. He had come in to the florist to feed his cat, Zero, who lives at the florist shop and noticed an order on the computer. It was ours. He said he would stay that day to make the arrangement but would need our assistance in getting the flowers to the church. He remarked, "I don't come by every weekend but did stop to feed Zero. Thankfully I did."

Oh how I agreed. I imagined what we would have done if we had assumed the flowers were going to be at the church. We would have gone up to mingle with our family, would have looked to make sure the flowers were there. They wouldn't have been. And we would have been too emotional and too confused to understand why. AND too late to do anything about it.

That ole Zero. Though I never met him. He saved the day. Angels I guess come in all shapes and sizes AND breeds...</p>

    <h2>Headed to the OBX</h2>
    <h3>May 12th, 2015</h3>

    <p>I just sent my son off to his first official interview, dressed in a new handsome blue suit that my Dad decided he needed. He may be the only EMT dressed in a suit but he will be the best looking one there! He and I have been staying with my mom and dad since our uncle's funeral a week ago. A multi-generational family for a few days. It was rather nice. I imagined how it might be as it once was, a common rather than unusual way to live.

We all cooked together, had cocktails on the back porch and watched the birds eat and the deer tip toe through the woods thinking that we did not see them. Beloved flew in for a quick Mother's Day visit and my sister drove in from Winston-Salem that day as well. We all went to an old classic steak house that I had never been to and had mentioned once. My dad was determined to "check that one off the bucket list." It seems that everyone has items on my list and are working to see them to fruition. I find that so endearing.

Today marks the first day I have been alone in 15 days. For a woman who is used to being alone during the days surrounded by her two cats (that does sound so pitiful and odd) I have done more, driven more, talked more than I have in a year. My body and mind are worn out.

I am within an hour of driving to the OBX and taking a long walk on the beach to unwind and sort things through. One of my colleagues from my years at Cone Hospital is meeting me tomorrow to unload my car for me. And afterward we are going across the street for lunch. I think I can safely say that summer has started for me.</p>

    <h2>Settling in at the OBX</h2>
    <h3>May 13th, 2015</h3>
    <p>I am sitting here sipping coffee looking around and marveling all that has transpired in the last fifteen days. And it was a humbling reminder that I am not in control of much. Between the funeral and the graduation, my hard drive crashed and at the time, I thought, "Really?" But with so much going on, it was just another annoyance to be dealt with later.

    I did manage to buy a smaller laptop which I thought was wise since my strength and agility are decreasing. I set it up last evening on the kitchen bar so I would be ready to pound out something pithy this morning -ha. But, no. It is not picking up our wifi here so I am working off my iPad which is never relaxing for me to do. I am baby boomer enough that I like to feel the key pads underneath my fingertips when I type. Speaking of writing, I confess I like a little paper in my life as well. It is good for scratching out notes or to do's when you no longer can keep anything in your spongiform head.

    So that's a lot of nothing for today. My former co-worker is on his 30 mile trip up Highway 12 (he lives at the southern tip of the island, I live at the northern tip.) He is unloading my car but word has it, he is bringing one of his dogs to visit me. If you never hear from me again, it is because I was charged with dognapping.</p>

    <h2>Someone Following Me</h2>
    <h3>May 14th, 2015</h3>

    <p>Although I am not Catholic and know little to nothing about saints, I seem to have one following me wherever I go. Let me explain. He was first introduced to me by my mother's neighbor one evening in a glass of champagne.

And then last month when we spent those few days in Florida, someone made me a cucumber martini and again there he was swirling around in my glass with my gin.

It was time to find out who this Saint Germaine guy was. It appears that he comes from France in the form of little white flowers called elder flowers. There is  a small window of availability for picking these and up into the Alps someone goes to get them. They are then macerated and turned into a liqueur that smells like grapefruit to me with a hint of something floral.

So back to Raleigh last week where I took Mom, Dad, and my son to a graduation dinner and we had been talking about this liqueur. Well, quite frankly, we had been replicating the Florida drink for days....at the end of the meal, the waitress handed us the dessert menu and wouldn't you know it, the last item was a lemon tart with St. Germaine! We had to try it.

Now as you know, I am at the OBX and was sitting here last evening just a bit blue and decided to walk over to "my" restaurant for a glass of wine and a little conversation. Both of my guys were there and I was so happy to see them. Although they handed me a menu I told them I was just there for a minute. About a half hour later, I looked down and guess who had followed to the beach? It was a gin julep- gin, ole St. Germaine, mint, cucumber and lime. Holy cow! I'm in love! And now I'm thinking I might need to name my imaginary dog after him!</p>

    <h2>The Circle of Life</h2>
    <h3>May 15th,2015</h3>

    <p>Indulge me one more time about my uncle. He was a lover of fire trucks and fire stations although he was never a fireman. When he got confused five weeks ago and drove around Charlotte trying to find his way home or his way to work, I think it interesting that he stopped at a fire station.  Something in his brain, while it was swelling and causing him great confusion,  looked familiar when he noticed the fire house. Those men took quick vitals, knew something was wrong and rushed him to the hospital. God bless those men.

    We all know how it ended. Undiagnosed cancer from a never identified melanoma, metastatic to the lungs and on to the brain. He died five weeks from the day he drove up to the fire station.

    We had his funeral as you know a week ago and I believe I wrote that the family (all 20 of us from infant to 70+) ate at my uncle's favorite barbecue place as a tribute. While we were all there winding down and talking - many of us had not seen each other in several years -  a fire truck pulled up and several men got out at the restaurant to have their evening meal. We all looked at each other. From fire station to fire truck - our uncle was saying one last good-bye.</p>

    <h2>Last Thursday, a Great Day at the OBX</h2>
    <h3>May 18th, 2015</h3>

    <p>So though my friend did not bring up one of his dogs as I thought, we had a delightful afternoon sitting on my upper deck talking, reminiscing and sipping iced tea after helping me unload my car. I cannot tell you how much he unloaded. After the fourth eight-pack of toilet paper, he asked what in the world we planned to do this summer! I told him he didn't quite understand how large our combined families were and all of the coming and going that we anticipated this summer.

    He left later in the day and that night he emailed me and said he had read my blog belatedly and felt just awful about not bringing one of his dogs up to see me. I told him that he had all summer to do that. He then mentioned that he had two bikes that he would love to loan me if I thought I would like to use them. I envisioned this cool 50's looking bicycle and though I had not idea what it was going to look like, I told him, "Sure!"

    The next day he came up with two bikes in his truck along with a gift from his wife whom I have never met though I have eaten many of her delicious cheesecakes through the years. He handed me the tiniest of boxes and in it  was a tiny little hedgehog charm!

    Then when I looked in the back of his truck I saw the bicycle of my dreams! It was aqua blue, 50's style and I squealed like a school girl. It has the old-fashioned brakes that you back peddle to engage. I jumped on it like a twelve year old and only after I had it going down the road did it dawn on me that I hadn't been on a bicycle since the 1970's. Just to let you know, you can get back on a bicyle and ride off into the sunset.

    My friend and his wife made me very happy last week. I just need to ask them if I can put a basket on the front. When I mentioned that to Beloved today and then turned around and said, "But what do I need a basket for?" suddenly feeling foolish, he responded, "Maybe a dog?" He SAID IT. I kid you not.</p>

    <h2>A Tribute to Ginger</h2>
    <h3>May 19th, 2015</h3>

    <p>So I have been doing a lot of thinking about bicycles since my friend dropped that cool thing off last week. My bike when I was younger was a little darker but it was a beautiful aquamarine blue with a banana seat (remember those?) that had a sparkle to it. I had turquoise blue streamers off the handlebars  AND a white wicker basket on the front which leads me to Ginger.

    My dad came home one day with a bird dog puppy. I remember her being just about the cutest thing I had ever  seen. He let my sister and me name her and we chose Ginger - after the voluptuous Ginger on Gilligan's Island. What were we thinking?

    A few days later Mom took us to the grocery store and while there we picked out a dog collar - a diamond encrusted thing more suited for a poodle than bird dog but hey, we thought it worked well with her namesake.

    Through the weeks and ensuing months my dad tried to teach her to point - after all that was what she was meant to do...but the only thing she would point for was birthday cake. No, I am not kidding. She would stand stock still in our backyard staring down that piece of cake until someone told her to retrieve it and she did.

    My dad apparently gave up. With a name like Ginger wearing a diamond collar what could he expect? Except that soon after, I tossed her into my white wicker basket and took off down our street with her flappy bird dog ears fluttering in the wind.

    She was a good dog. And I think her sparkly dog collar went perfectly well with my aquamarine bicycle. As my life winds down, I often think about pets that have died and I am hoping that I will see Ginger again one day (along with a few other pets of mine). And since I will no longer be sick or middle-aged I am hoping she will be waiting for me in a heavenly wicker basket. We'll see.</p>

    <h2>An Old Adage: Don't Believe Everything You See (or Read)</h2>
    <h3>May 20th, 2015</h3>

    <p><span style="color: #008080;">I was made aware of this article from <em>The Australian </em>a few weeks ago and decided I needed to share it with you for a variety of reasons. First of all, I think we should all be very careful whether we are the sick ones or we are trying to help those of us who are sick with advice on what we should eat, drink, do, not do etc. I am a member of a closed group on Facebook of advanced cancer patients and you would be amazed at what has been suggested we eat, inject, drink and so on by well meaning friends. Lemon with baking soda seems to be all the rage (ugh). </span>

    <span style="color: #008080;">But also there are women who are trying to scam the good hearted out there with fund raisers and there are several who have made thousands upon thousands of dollars fraudulently.</span>

    <span style="color: #008080;">So I will probably sound like your mother but please dispense advice sparingly and give your money wisely. I can't imagine using this horrible disease for ill gain but it's out there. I mean, look at this sweet girl's face. Would you for a second suspect her of lying?</span>

    <strong>Disgraced wellness blogger, Belle Gibson, has confessed that she lied about having cancer and curing her illness with a regime of healthy eating and natural therapies. <!-- google_ad_section_end(name=story_introduction) --> <!-- // .story-intro --></strong> <!-- google_ad_section_start(name=story_body, weight=high) -->

    Ms Gibson launched The Whole Pantry as a “lifestyle and wellness” app in 2013 after claiming in her blog to have survived an aggressive malignant brain tumour using only natural foods and alternative therapies. She also later claimed to be suffering cancers in her liver, spleen, uterus and blood.

    But after months of scrutiny of her story,<a href="http://www.theaustralian.com.au/opinion/a-healthy-dose-of-scepticism-about-belle-gibson/story-e6frg6zo-1227261880798"> including by <i>The Australian</i></a>, the 23-year-old has come clean.

    In an interview with <a href="http://www.aww.com.au/latest-news/in-the-mag/belle-gibson-teaser-20269"><i>The Australian Women’s Weekly</i></a>, Ms Gibson was asked if she had, or ever had cancer. “No. None of it’s true,” she told the magazine.

    “I don’t want forgiveness,” she told <i>The Weekly </i>which describes her as “the girl who conned us all’’.

    “I just think [speaking out] was the responsible thing to do. Above anything, I would like people to say, ‘Okay, she’s human.’”

    <a href="http://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/mega-blogger-belle-gibson-casts-doubt-on-her-own-cancer-claims/story-e6frg8zx-1227255933051">In March, Ms Gibson, whose story of miraculous survival from terminal cancer helped launch her global “health and wellness” business, admitted that her claim of suffering multiple life-threatening cancers may be false</a>. Gibson said her announcement last year that she was suffering from cancer of the liver, uterus, spleen and blood was based on a “misdiagnosis” by a doctor she won’t name. “It’s hard to admit that maybe you were wrong,” she said, adding that she felt “confused, bordering on humiliated”.

    But last month, Gibson was still standing by her claim that she has used alternative therapies to survive an aggressive malignant brain tumour for five years without any conventional medical treatment. <a href="http://www.theaustralian.com.au/opinion/a-healthy-dose-of-scepticism-about-belle-gibson/story-e6frg6zo-1227261880798">An investigation by <i>The Australian </i>uncovered a series of unusual and contradictory medical claims by Gibson dating from May 2009, when she claimed to have undergone multiple heart surgery operations and momentarily died on an operating table</a>.

    Gibson had also stated that in July that same year, when she was 20, a doctor told her she had terminal brain cancer and would be dead in four months. But according to the birth date on her own corporate filings, she was 17 at the time.

    Ms Gibson’s Australian publisher, Lantern, confirmed that it had never asked for documentary verification of her medical condition or her age before publishing her book <i>The Whole Pantry </i>in October.

    Ms Gibson told <i>The Weekly </i>although she was passionate about avoiding gluten, dairy and coffee, she didn’t really understand how cancer works.

    The magazine, which goes on sale tomorrow, said that it made no payment for the interview.</p>

    <h2>187 Fake Cures For Cancer That Consumers Should Avoid</h2>
    <h3>May 21st, 2015</h3>

    <p>Although I can safely say I have never heard of these odd sounding "cures" apparently there are many people who have been duped by these companies. I found this list on  the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) website of almost 200 'drugs' that people should avoid. I guess the biggest thing I take away from this is the number of drugs that are out there and the possibility of desperate people that might try anything.

    <h2>Curative versus Adjuvant Therapy</h2>
    <h2>May 22nd, 2015</h2>

    <p>I am always amazed at what catches a reader's eye and what does not. And if it catches one's eye, it always surprises me what people will take the time to comment about. Yesterday was a good example. If I think the topic I have written about will interest a broad audience I will post my blog to a couple of metastatic breast cancer facebook sites. I also post, on an occasion, to another site where you can join various health communities and discuss the issues at hand.

    I sent the blog around yesterday as I thought it was interesting to know that there were that many 'drugs' out there that people were spending hope and money on.

    What I didn't realize was that many would say they were actually taking some of them, a couple of these drugs were fairly popular. I got a lot of comments on my lack of understanding of what was helping out in the cancer community.  What the average person might not understand is that something might be 'helping' someone (whether truly helping or via placebo effect) but helping doesn't mean it is curing anyone from cancer. And I think that's what is escaping many. After all one reader reminded me that chemo isn't curing cancer anymore than the fraudulent drugs that the FDA has listed.

    Some of these patients have their oncologists' blessing and knowledge while using some of the drugs on yesterday's list, some of them do not. It really was a hot topic that I didn't see coming and a lot of passion around the topic of complementary medicine and immense distrust in the FDA.

    For the record, I have never taken any of them and as long as one's oncologist knows that you are taking them, I am fine with it. I believe it's only fair to my physician that she knows everything I am doing (whether illegal, legal, herbal, etc) so that as my lab work comes back and my scans come  back, she has a full picture of what I am ingesting so she can interpret results correctly.</p>

      <h2>Updates That Have Left Me Smiling</h2>
      <h3>May 26th, 2015</h3>

      <p>Beloved's sister and her family were here at the OBX for the long weekend. We always have a great time with this rowdy bunch. By rowdy, I mean they are fun and high-spirited. The weather here has been picture perfect. Clear blue skies, cool nights. We have had a relaxing time. They even humored me while I 'escorted' them out of the neighborhood (on their way back to Philly) last evening on my bicycle!

      Other good news? My son was pulled off a soccer field last week with a phone call from an agency that he had applied to a couple of months ago. They wanted to interview him - that day?! He went over and performed the required agility testing, written test and interview....they had interviewed a bunch of people...then, they offered him a job on the spot. Wisely, he said he needed to sleep on it. He did and wisely - ha - called his mother and talked to me about it and then accepted the next morning. Halleluiah! He starts on Monday.

      <p style="text-align: left;">I opened a package on Saturday and out popped a handmade pillow from England with a couple of hedgehogs on it! A cousin of mine had been perusing Estsy and found this artist who designs and sews these lovely pillows - amazing detail.  What a surprise it was!</p>

      <p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.sherrifillipo.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/desk-e1432650546334.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2492" src="http://www.sherrifillipo.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/desk-e1432650546334.jpg" alt="desk" width="240" height="320" /></a></p>

      Last but not least, when I was at Mom and Dad's a couple of weeks ago between the funeral and graduation, I noticed an old desk in their garage that caught my eye. I had been looking online and in Corning for something that would fit perfectly in a corner of the beach house where I could blog and write. (I love anything and everything related to an office. It's quite pathetic. I could spend hours at Staples looking at file folders and paper clips.) Come to find out the desk was a teacher's desk that came from my elementary school - the same school Mom and Dad went to! I forget how Dad got it. The school was torn down years ago. But being the great parents that they are, they put the desk on their truck and delivered it to me over the weekend. I used a little Murphy's Oil Soap on it and I am in love with it. What a surprise sitting in their garage!

      I don't think I could take anymore!</p>

      <h2>Back in Corning for a Few Weeks</h2>
      <h3>May 28th, 2015</h3>

      <p>We arrived back home in Corning around 11:00 Tuesday night. I have come home for a couple of weeks to do things I had lined up back in the winter time. One of my <a href="http://www.sherrifillipo.com/?p=2218" target="_blank">silver girls </a>is coming to lecture at Grand Rounds in a week or so. She is an outstanding presenter. I can't wait to give the healthcare system an hour of her knowledge. I will be the one in the back cheering her on. She is an epidemiologist who holds national chair positions in her field and has become a dear friend since my days in Connecticut. After her lecture, she and I will have the weekend together. She, being French, loves champagne as much as I (non-French) do! A bottle or two may be consumed as we sit on the terrace...

      My mom, aunt and cousin are also coming up for a few days. Can't wait for that either. They are driving but unlike when my dad drove us all to South Carolina to celebrate my <a href="http://www.sherrifillipo.com/?p=1671">uncle's 90th birthday</a>, theses ladies (Think Driving Miss Daisy) are putting the pedal to the metal themselves. Oh my. Mom wants to go back to Ithaca, hippie that she is. There is a super interesting old book store (behind the famous '70s hippie restaurant <a href="http://www.moosewoodcooks.com/">Moosewood  Restaurant</a>) where she wants to spend more time.

      It is also time for more blood work and time to "flush and lock" my port as it is called. I don't know why I didn't think about the need to keep this thing in my chest operational. Per vascular protocol, (every two months) ports should be flushed with saline to ensure they are still working and then "locked" with heparin so that they don't clot off. It's no big deal - just a trip to the hospital. I am interested in seeing what my tumor marker indicates. It's obtained through a simple blood test that can show micrometastases meaning it can show cancer activity long before it would appear on a scan. It may sound contradictory to want to know what a number is if you are not going to treat that number. But for me, it will just give me a little update on how quickly or how slowly things are progressing. It will be three months since chemo by the time they draw that lab. And I am curious.

      It's odd being back in Corning but in a good way. When I left the trees were bare and there was a hard frost. Today, everything is in full leaf and it is in the mid-70's. The wind has picked up and the green hills are so soothing to look out upon. I told Beloved I might have a hard time staying at the beach after all. I may need a fix of each and may need to go back and forth more than I thought. We will see.</p>

    <h2>Young Women and Breast Cancer</h2>
    <h3>May 29th, 2015</h3>

    <p>Over the past few months, I have provided information on the various kinds of breast cancer but haven't gone into other areas such as age, ethnicity or sexual orientation. Today, I wanted to highlight some facts on those women who are at a different place in their lives than I am   - and that is the young woman who has been diagnosed. The information I am using today comes directly from a great website <a href="http://www.lbbc.org/" target="_blank">Living Beyond Breast Cancer</a>. This website has a myriad of information, events, help lines and so on that you will find helpful no matter your age.



    A <a href="http://www.lbbc.org/Audiences/Young-Women/Learn-About-Breast-Cancer-and-Young-Women" target="_blank">young woman with a breast cancer </a>diagnosis is defined as someone under the age of 45. Facts about these women include:

    <ul>

    	<li>5% of woman diagnosed in the US are under the age of 40.</li>

    	<li>Every year, over 11,000 are diagnosed with invasive breast cancer and over 1700 are diagnosed with in situ breast cancer (cancer that has not moved outside the ducts.)</li>

    	<li>Younger women tend to have negative hormone receptors (negative for estrogen, progesterone and the protein Her2) See previous post on <a href="http://www.sherrifillipo.com/?p=2147">Triple Negative Breast Cancer</a> for more specific information.</li>

    </ul>

    <strong>Why do young women get breast cancer so early? Some reasons include:</strong>

    <ul>

    	<li>younger women might ignore a lump or discharge from the nipple because they don't believe it could be possible to have cancer so young</li>

    	<li>research indicates that younger women are often encouraged to 'wait and watch' a lump more often than older women</li>

    	<li>breast tissue is more dense in younger women and being able to palpate (feel) a lump may be more difficult</li>

    	<li>dense tissue makes reading a mammogram more difficult</li>

    </ul>

    For those of you who would like more information, Living Beyond Breast Cancer is hosting an event <a href="http://www.lbbc.org/Events/2015-06-13-Breast-Cancer-360-Young-Women">Breast Cancer 360: Mapping the Future for Young Women With Breast Cancer</a> on Saturday, June 13, 2015 from 9:00am - 12 noon eastern standard time.  The event can be attended in person or online.
