    <h2>Going Viral: Stomp Out Breast Cancer Monday</h2>
    <h3>March 2nd, 2015</h3>

    <p>This is a video of a young woman in North Carolina who is like many of us, is living and dying with metastatic breast cancer. She gave an interview last week wanting today, March 2, 2015 to be "Stomp Out Cancer Monday." Though I am often wary when I read titles like this, she was quite eloquent in her explanation of  metastatic disease and why society <strong>must</strong> understand the difference between breast cancer and metastatic breast cancer.

    <h2>The Easter Bunny May Be a Little Late This Year</h2>
    <h3>March 3rd, 2015</h3>

    <p><p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.sherrifillipo.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/rabbit.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1907" src="http://www.sherrifillipo.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/rabbit-768x1024.jpg" alt="rabbit" width="500" height="667" /></a></p>

    <span style="color: #008080;">(This post was postponed one day due to the need to publish the 'stomp out cancer' post on Monday.)</span>

    So I am sure you have heard that NC got a few inches of snow last week. I had no fewer than four texts, pictures and even one video of friends and family showing me snow! The longer I live in the north, the more I want to join in and  say, "Aren't those southerners cute in their fascination of the white stuff?" But I am really no better as evidenced by the photo of me from a week ago Friday standing out on the sidewalk in Corning...

    But today being Monday and  most of you who know, it is <em>Momma Monday</em>. So here is my story. Friday morning, I got a facetime request from Mom. And off we went. She was sitting in her flannel pajamas stating that she had taken a break from cleaning the kitchen. And I noticed that she kept looking off as if looking out a window. "What are you doing" I asked her and she lamented that the snow had already fallen off the trees and it was slowly melting. I asked her if she had made the rabbit on the tree yet. Another  Pintrest photo that we each had seen a few weeks back.

    You should have seen the face she made when she yelled out, "NO! I absolutely forgot!" And she began to grumble. I told her to go on out there and do it before it was too late. (The chance of there being any more snow this season is almost nil and the chance of them getting  another 6 inches is years away.) So, she agreed she needed to do it and hung up.

    About an hour later I got the above picture. When I called her, she told me it took a lot of work as one little leg would start sliding down the limb before she could get the other one made. But obviously she succeeded. As we talked, I began to hear splashing sounds and I asked, "Mom. What do I hear? Are you talking to me in the bathtub?"

    "Yes I am! Do you know how cold it was out there in my pajamas and work boots? I nearly froze to death." All I could envision were the neighbors watching her from the warmth of their kitchens shaking their heads going, "Gladys. You've got to come over here and see what this nut is up to this time!"

    I began to laugh and told her I couldn't talk to her any longer. I had to text Dad to show him what his bride is up to while he toils away at work all day. I am afraid if I don't show him at that moment, by the time he got home, Bunny Rabbit will have slid down the tree and hopped off into the woods.</p>

    <h2>Chemo Brain is Alive and Well</h2>
    <h3>March 4th, 2015</h3>

    <p>Though insidious, chemo brain is with me all the time. It pops up at the most inopportune times. I found another New York Times article that I thought would bring this home to those of you who are working with or living with someone who is or has been on chemo in the past. Some researchers says though the chemo  brain effects may lessen over time, the phenomenon may never go away. (So be patient with us!)   Click the link below to access the article:</p>

    <h2>Male Breast Cancer: Similarities & Differences</h2>
    <h3>March 5th, 2015</h3>

    <p>http://www.sherrifillipo.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/male-and-female-breast-tissue.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1960" src="http://www.sherrifillipo.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/male-and-female-breast-tissue.png" alt="male and female breast tissue" width="500" height="333" /></a></p>


Male breast cancer isn't discussed much for many societal reasons, I believe. But I thought it was significant enough as we broaden all the myriad of ways breast cancer can change the lives of us or our family members. Below are some statistics that both show the similarities and dissimilarities of the disease by sex. And at the bottom of the list is a video of an oncologist who actually has male breast cancer. I think he makes some great points and wanted to include it here.

<p style="text-align: right;"><a href="http://www.sherrifillipo.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/tshirt.jpg"><img class=" size-full wp-image-1961 alignright" src="http://www.sherrifillipo.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/tshirt.jpg" alt="tshirt" width="259" height="194" />

</a></p>

<strong>According to MedicineNet.com website:</strong>

<ul>

	<li>Male breast cancer is rare, only about 1% of all breast cancers</li>

	<li>The risk is increased by elevated estrogen, previous radiation and family history of cancer</li>

	<li>Infiltrating ductal carcinoma is the most common type of male breast cancer</li>

	<li>A lump beneath the nipple is the most common symptom of male breast cancer</li>

	<li>Male breast cancer is staged (determining the extent of spread of the tumor) the same way as women's breast cancer is staged</li>

	<li>According to the National Breast Cancer Foundation, men carry a higher mortality than women do, primarily because awareness among men is less and men are less likely to assume a lump is breast cancer, which can cause a delay in seeking treatment</li>

	<li>This year, an estimated 2,360 men in the United States will be diagnosed with breast cancer. An estimated 430 men will die from it.</li>

    <h2>Bells Versus Balloons</h2>
    <h3>March 6th, 2015</h3>

    <p>Yesterday I had chemotherapy at my home town hospital instead of taking that 45 mile ride through the hills of NY/PA. I did it because it is only 5 miles from my home and my oncologist is now spending her Thursdays there. Since it was the hospital I used to work at (therefore I know a lot of folks there) I thought I would try it. And since my love is process improvement I was interested in seeing the differences in infusion practices between the two facilities. What I ended up ruminating about afterward  I could have never guessed.

    <h2>Fall 2014</h2>

    Going back a few months, I read in our hospital newsletter that we were going to be filming commercials to advertise our new hospital in Corning. A long time in coming, a brand new facility was being constructed and we wanted to showcase some of our new departments. When the announcement came about the ads, one of them was going to be for our new cancer center. Up until now, our oncology service was in a building just down the road from the old hospital. Now it would be a part of our new facility and it was going to be gorgeous. A fireplace in the waiting area, huge windows that looked out upon our rolling hills. Thinking outside the box, I queried if I could be considered for the cancer patient as they were going to be using many local folks. The response back was for that role, the producer wanted to use an actress (!) as he didn't think a 'real' patient could hold up under the time it would take to shoot a commercial. I thought having a real cancer patient and employee of the organization to boot would be a cool way to convey the story but alas, it was not to be.

    Several months later, while watching television, the ad popped up. Some of the people I recognized and then there she was, head wrapped in a scarf "completing" her chemo and ringing a bell for all the world to see and hear that she was finished with treatment. It was a very well done commercial.

    <h2>Yesterday</h2>

    Fast forward to yesterday. The place, as lovely as I remembered it. The oncology team was competent and exceedingly friendly. Friends/colleagues of mine found me and it was good to be surrounded by them. As my infusion was running, I heard a bell ringing. And ringing. And ringing. And I had a flashback of the commercial and a sudden awareness that someone in the center had completed her treatment. (To my knowledge nothing like this is done where I usually have my chemo.)

    I had the oddest and saddest flood of emotion wash over me. While hesitatingly happy for this woman, I fantasized about running out and yelling something - some word of caution without spoiling her moment. I then remembered in Virginia when my treatment was completed, they gave me a bouquet of balloons. That made me very happy and indeed I thought I had 'beat' it and would never have to look at those women again. The only thing I think now is that I am glad the balloons were quiet and did not bother those women who were there with terminal disease knowing that their balloons were never going to arrive.</p>

    <h2>Viruses Killing Cancers: What You Need to Know</h2>
    <h3>March 9th, 2015</h3>

    <p>Lots of folks have asked me about the HBO/VICE documentary that was recently on television. Three physician researchers were interviewed along with three patients who had their cancers "cured" by reengineering viruses  and using them to "attack" and kill three different types of cancers. The cold virus used to 'cure' a brain tumor, the measles virus to 'cure' multiple myeloma and the HIV virus to 'cure' leukemia. (I have placed a link to the documentary at the bottom of this post.)</p>

I know it sounds like science fiction but the physicians come from world renowned institutions: the Mayo Clinic, MD Anderson Cancer Center and the University of Pennsylvania. And indeed it appears they are on to something. But here is the rub: shows like these tend to be highly sensational - they're meant to be and I get that. If it doesn't sound interesting or provocative who is going to watch, right? But I worry for all those thousands out there who are out of options and are looking for a cure.  They are desperate for their loved ones. I guess you could say it grieves me because the likelihood of this methodology being used in the near future isn't probable though the documentary approaches it as if it is.



<strong>Here are a few things which the program didn't discuss:</strong>

<ul>

	<li>the researchers are talking about very small numbers of patients who have been cured using this method; there would need to be thousands more subjects to truly say they had found something that worked; one of the researchers at the American Cancer Society said that curing individuals versus curing cancer are two entirely different things</li>

	<li>there are no long term outcomes yet; the subjects may all get cancer again</li>

	<li>the cancers that were discussed were mostly  "liquid" cancers not solid cancers like breast, lung and colon cancer</li>

	<li>patients and families across the country may get their hopes up too high, thinking that there is an imminent cure for whatever type of cancer they have</li>

</ul>

I wanted to show you something that astounded me - just to drive a point home. The alphabetized list below is a list ONLY of drugs A-D that were once on the market and then later withdrawn by the FDA.  This means that  after the public began using them, they were shown to be dangerous (examples being liver toxicity, cardiac toxicity). I know I am being dramatic but I wanted to show you a very partial list of drugs that went through all the clinical trials required and were approved by the FDA and then withdrawn. Linking this back to the topic at hand, while I agree this is an exciting topic to think about and discuss, all the answers are not known yet in which to determine its efficacy. Please don't think I am a naysayer. I'm right along with everybody hoping for a cure as I sure do need one. But the nurse in me is cautionary and I feel I must show the other side of the coin.

  <h2>My Friends at the Social Security Office</h2>
  <h3>March 10th, 2015</h3>

  <p>Lest you think that my interactions with government officials ended with my experience last year with the TSA lady, you would be wrong. I wish you weren't ...For those of you who are not aware, like many people across the country, I am on social security disability - based on diagnosis and prognosis, I get a small paycheck every month. And as you would expect, there are governmental constraints associated with this payment. One is that if you want to 'try' to return to work, you may do so for a certain number of months and then when you reach that limit, you can continue to work as long as the earnings are not "substantial." So as many of you know, last year I worked from home and did some teaching at the hospital and tried to keep my hours down.</p>

<h2>Last Week</h2>

As the new year rolled around, I received a January check but not February. "Oh, no," I thought, "Here we go again." And sure enough off we went. Luckily the social security department is two blocks away (I told you Corning was golden!) and I walked there last week, took a number and settled in for a long wait. Sure enough, they didn't disappoint! When my number was called, I went up to a very public window in front of the world and queried about my missing check. It doesn't take much to befuddle. The kind lady printed out reams of paper about me (I can only imagine what she learned) and then said she had no idea. She then put a call into Albany and told me to sit back down.

I sat back down and watched the TV screen scroll through a myriad of governmental notices in Spanish. I tried to make a game of how many words I could translate on my own. But when they began to use a large white cat with big blue eyes to explain something about social security, I couldn't make sense of it. Who was that cat supposed to represent? Obama? Me? Then my number was called again.

The nice lady told me that "they" were still trying determine my eligibility for 2015. Did they know something that I did not? Did something in that ream of paper she printed tell her that I had been cured of cancer? Had I gotten some virus while sitting in a room full of coughing, sneezing people that targeted my cancer and now I was healed? Alas, I was told to go home and call Albany.

<h2>Back Home and Then Back Again</h2>

Albany told me that I was now approved for 2015 and that a (late) check would be deposited in my bank within a week. I thanked her and the next day I looked online because that's just the way I am and do you know what I found? Two checks deposited! You would have thought I would have been thrilled but all I could think about was having to trek back to that office and off I went. The nice lady continued to be befuddled. Another call to Albany. Then the answer: you have been paid late for one check and early for another so you are ahead until April. <em>What?</em> I thanked her and as I left, because it is a public arena for all to hear, on old farmer looked up at me and said," You can't make this stuff up!" I told him it had to be the new math and I couldn't understand a word she said.

<h2>Yesterday</h2>

Is it over? Not hardly. A few days later, I looked in my bank account again and guess what? Another check!! <em>What? A third trip back to the SS office?</em> I began to think this was my oncologist's sneaky way to get me up and out and walking on frozen sidewalks. Back I went. The same lady stood at the same open window. I knew the drill. I signed in, took my number and sat down. What I haven't told you to this point is that there is an armed sheriff who works there - just sitting waiting on one of us to go postal I guess...and I can understand why. And there she sat. Suddenly chemo drug kicked me in my stomach and I had to make a quick judgment: hold it in and hope my number was called quickly or lose my place in line and beg the armed guard for a bathroom. Chemo wins every time. What I didn't expect was for her to escort me to the bathroom and stand guard while I used it. Was I being protected or being guarded?

Walking back with my personal sheriff, I thanked her and told her sometimes chemo sneaks up on me. Then without warning, she smiled and started to tell me about her mother who is on an oral chemo for lung cancer and said, "You know that woman never smoked a day in her life." I told her I was sorry. She then rested her hand on her revolver and asked me if I had been "living clean." Crap, I thought. What does she mean? I divulged, "I have never smoked either." And left it at that. Whew...

Soon my number was called and when I told the nice lady  I had received another check, she told me she knew and tried to explain the above scenario. No, I told her, a third check. And I handed her a personal check to cover the one I had just gotten. Well, I about blew her mind.  She started tapping on that computer, paper starting spewing out of her printer. Oh glory. All I wanted to do was run home and put my head under my pillow. She told me there were no notes about this check and if I gave it to her it might mess things up. (Oh, I thought, no lady, if I KEEP this check, it will mess things up.) She fretted and fretted and then finally took my check and sighed.

As I was trying to get away quickly lest she change her mind, the sheriff called me over and said, "You look so young to have cancer. But you know what? You look great." And as I pushed open the door, she yelled, "Keep eating healthy!" Oh my...</p>

    <h2>Tears of Laughter: Good for the Soul</h2>
    <h3>March 11th, 2015</h3>

    <p>So I called Momma yesterday and forgot it was her "flower shuttle" day where a group of people get together, design small flower arrangements and  then take them to nursing homes. Don't you think that is a cool idea? I love flowers at my bedside and can only imagine the positive impact that small gesture has.  It has been a nice way for Mom to integrate into a new community. She was driving home when I called so I knew she wanted me to read that day's blog. It's just our routine. She drives. I read. But on the funny post days (well at least I think they are funny) I am always worried she might drive off into a ditch. So far so good. But it reminds me of one day many years ago when we were out shopping. I was the one driving and she looked over at me and said, "Look at this picture." When I looked down, I wasn't prepared for what I saw. There was my mother and a friend riding a mechanical bull. One hand on the saddle, one hand up in the air and a look of startle on her face. I started laughing uncontrollably; I started crying and then I couldn't see the road. Looking back now, I don't think I have ever laughed any harder than that afternoon. Why would she endanger our lives like that?</p>

There was my mother with a little red bandana tied just so around her neck. She was wearing a cowboy hat. It had to be borrowed. Heaven knows she doesn't wear one in NC. But the funniest thing was, if you looked really closely you could see she was in a nice pair of dress flats which to me made it all the funnier. I think she must have been at a conference of some sort, knowing we don't have 10-gallon hats or mechanical bulls in Winston-Salem. The one thing you can say about my mother is that she is a good sport.

Fast forward to two years ago, we were sitting in Mom's den  - my son, Dad, sister and Mom - one Sunday afternoon sorting through piles of old pictures and wouldn't you know that bull photo rose to the top of the heap. My sister started giggling, she handed it to me and I started giggling. The room was soon awash in laughter. Mom is so tiny, that bull so outrageously gigantic and the look on her face was, "How did I get up here?"

Unbeknownst to either of us, while siting at the beach last summer, that same darn picture came up in conversation. I had secretly taken a picture of it on my phone and once my sister started talking about it, I jauntily pulled it out to show her. She just raised one eyebrow, whipped out her phone and showed me her own copy. Mom just rolled her eyes. She is after all, a very good sport.</p>

    <h2>Both Sides Now: What Happens When a Nurse Becomes a Patient?</h2>
    <h3>March 12th, 2015</h3>

    <p>I was  interviewed this week by the Metastatic Breast Cancer Network. The title of the article:

    <strong>Both Sides Now: What Happens When a Nurse Becomes a Patient? </strong>

    The link below will take you to the website. There is a part two of the interview which will be posted this weekend. It was a question and answer interview.

    <h2>Four of Us</h2>
    <h3>March 13th, 2015</h3>

    <p>I had just finished my morning devotional and was thinking how relevant it was when the phone rang. The devotional today was teaching the reader to learn to live above one's circumstances and that "trouble and distress are woven into the very fabric of this perishing world..." The verse today for reflection was, "So with you: Now is your time of grief, but I will see you again and you will rejoice and no one will take away your joy John 16:22.



    So the phone. It was Mom. She had just learned of a close family member who was rushed to the hospital yesterday, healthy up until that point. This relative was told yesterday that there is metastatic cancer in the brain. I was stunned. I am stunned. This family member, to his/her knowledge never knew he/she had cancer to begin with.



    So as I write, I have had three calls since Christmas of three fairly young family members all of whom have been given a diagnosis of cancer. All of them completely out of the blue. Multiple pockets of our family shocked beyond belief. If you add me, that makes four. I am very sad today. Not for me as much as for them. All four of us live so far from each other. My dream would be to magically jet to each one and tell them that I love them and how much they mean to me and to read the above scripture to them. I want them to know that this life is brief, like a mist, the Bible says that comes and then quickly goes. And that the unseen world, heaven, is just around the bend for all of us. Not the four of us, ALL of us.



    I remember being told many years ago that our lives are like weavings of cloth. We live underneath that cloth and see all the knots and stray threads. God is above that fabric and only sees the perfect design. When we die, we will be able to rise above our circumstances as the devotion says and we will finally be able to see that beautiful tapestry landscape.



    I am praying for my three beloved relatives. Would you say a prayer for them too?</p>
