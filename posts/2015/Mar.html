    <h2>Going Viral: Stomp Out Breast Cancer Monday</h2>
    <h3>March 2nd, 2015</h3>

    <p>This is a video of a young woman in North Carolina who is like many of us, is living and dying with metastatic breast cancer. She gave an interview last week wanting today, March 2, 2015 to be "Stomp Out Cancer Monday." Though I am often wary when I read titles like this, she was quite eloquent in her explanation of  metastatic disease and why society <strong>must</strong> understand the difference between breast cancer and metastatic breast cancer.

    <h2>The Easter Bunny May Be a Little Late This Year</h2>
    <h3>March 3rd, 2015</h3>

    <p><p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.sherrifillipo.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/rabbit.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1907" src="http://www.sherrifillipo.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/rabbit-768x1024.jpg" alt="rabbit" width="500" height="667" /></a></p>

    <span style="color: #008080;">(This post was postponed one day due to the need to publish the 'stomp out cancer' post on Monday.)</span>

    So I am sure you have heard that NC got a few inches of snow last week. I had no fewer than four texts, pictures and even one video of friends and family showing me snow! The longer I live in the north, the more I want to join in and  say, "Aren't those southerners cute in their fascination of the white stuff?" But I am really no better as evidenced by the photo of me from a week ago Friday standing out on the sidewalk in Corning...

    But today being Monday and  most of you who know, it is <em>Momma Monday</em>. So here is my story. Friday morning, I got a facetime request from Mom. And off we went. She was sitting in her flannel pajamas stating that she had taken a break from cleaning the kitchen. And I noticed that she kept looking off as if looking out a window. "What are you doing" I asked her and she lamented that the snow had already fallen off the trees and it was slowly melting. I asked her if she had made the rabbit on the tree yet. Another  Pintrest photo that we each had seen a few weeks back.

    You should have seen the face she made when she yelled out, "NO! I absolutely forgot!" And she began to grumble. I told her to go on out there and do it before it was too late. (The chance of there being any more snow this season is almost nil and the chance of them getting  another 6 inches is years away.) So, she agreed she needed to do it and hung up.

    About an hour later I got the above picture. When I called her, she told me it took a lot of work as one little leg would start sliding down the limb before she could get the other one made. But obviously she succeeded. As we talked, I began to hear splashing sounds and I asked, "Mom. What do I hear? Are you talking to me in the bathtub?"

    "Yes I am! Do you know how cold it was out there in my pajamas and work boots? I nearly froze to death." All I could envision were the neighbors watching her from the warmth of their kitchens shaking their heads going, "Gladys. You've got to come over here and see what this nut is up to this time!"

    I began to laugh and told her I couldn't talk to her any longer. I had to text Dad to show him what his bride is up to while he toils away at work all day. I am afraid if I don't show him at that moment, by the time he got home, Bunny Rabbit will have slid down the tree and hopped off into the woods.</p>

    <h2>Chemo Brain is Alive and Well</h2>
    <h3>March 4th, 2015</h3>

    <p>Though insidious, chemo brain is with me all the time. It pops up at the most inopportune times. I found another New York Times article that I thought would bring this home to those of you who are working with or living with someone who is or has been on chemo in the past. Some researchers says though the chemo  brain effects may lessen over time, the phenomenon may never go away. (So be patient with us!)   Click the link below to access the article:</p>

    <h2>Male Breast Cancer: Similarities & Differences</h2>
    <h3>March 5th, 2015</h3>

    <p>http://www.sherrifillipo.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/male-and-female-breast-tissue.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1960" src="http://www.sherrifillipo.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/male-and-female-breast-tissue.png" alt="male and female breast tissue" width="500" height="333" /></a></p>


Male breast cancer isn't discussed much for many societal reasons, I believe. But I thought it was significant enough as we broaden all the myriad of ways breast cancer can change the lives of us or our family members. Below are some statistics that both show the similarities and dissimilarities of the disease by sex. And at the bottom of the list is a video of an oncologist who actually has male breast cancer. I think he makes some great points and wanted to include it here.

<p style="text-align: right;"><a href="http://www.sherrifillipo.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/tshirt.jpg"><img class=" size-full wp-image-1961 alignright" src="http://www.sherrifillipo.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/tshirt.jpg" alt="tshirt" width="259" height="194" />

</a></p>

<strong>According to MedicineNet.com website:</strong>

<ul>

	<li>Male breast cancer is rare, only about 1% of all breast cancers</li>

	<li>The risk is increased by elevated estrogen, previous radiation and family history of cancer</li>

	<li>Infiltrating ductal carcinoma is the most common type of male breast cancer</li>

	<li>A lump beneath the nipple is the most common symptom of male breast cancer</li>

	<li>Male breast cancer is staged (determining the extent of spread of the tumor) the same way as women's breast cancer is staged</li>

	<li>According to the National Breast Cancer Foundation, men carry a higher mortality than women do, primarily because awareness among men is less and men are less likely to assume a lump is breast cancer, which can cause a delay in seeking treatment</li>

	<li>This year, an estimated 2,360 men in the United States will be diagnosed with breast cancer. An estimated 430 men will die from it.</li>

    <h2>Bells Versus Balloons</h2>
    <h3>March 6th, 2015</h3>

    <p>Yesterday I had chemotherapy at my home town hospital instead of taking that 45 mile ride through the hills of NY/PA. I did it because it is only 5 miles from my home and my oncologist is now spending her Thursdays there. Since it was the hospital I used to work at (therefore I know a lot of folks there) I thought I would try it. And since my love is process improvement I was interested in seeing the differences in infusion practices between the two facilities. What I ended up ruminating about afterward  I could have never guessed.

    <h2>Fall 2014</h2>

    Going back a few months, I read in our hospital newsletter that we were going to be filming commercials to advertise our new hospital in Corning. A long time in coming, a brand new facility was being constructed and we wanted to showcase some of our new departments. When the announcement came about the ads, one of them was going to be for our new cancer center. Up until now, our oncology service was in a building just down the road from the old hospital. Now it would be a part of our new facility and it was going to be gorgeous. A fireplace in the waiting area, huge windows that looked out upon our rolling hills. Thinking outside the box, I queried if I could be considered for the cancer patient as they were going to be using many local folks. The response back was for that role, the producer wanted to use an actress (!) as he didn't think a 'real' patient could hold up under the time it would take to shoot a commercial. I thought having a real cancer patient and employee of the organization to boot would be a cool way to convey the story but alas, it was not to be.

    Several months later, while watching television, the ad popped up. Some of the people I recognized and then there she was, head wrapped in a scarf "completing" her chemo and ringing a bell for all the world to see and hear that she was finished with treatment. It was a very well done commercial.

    <h2>Yesterday</h2>

    Fast forward to yesterday. The place, as lovely as I remembered it. The oncology team was competent and exceedingly friendly. Friends/colleagues of mine found me and it was good to be surrounded by them. As my infusion was running, I heard a bell ringing. And ringing. And ringing. And I had a flashback of the commercial and a sudden awareness that someone in the center had completed her treatment. (To my knowledge nothing like this is done where I usually have my chemo.)

    I had the oddest and saddest flood of emotion wash over me. While hesitatingly happy for this woman, I fantasized about running out and yelling something - some word of caution without spoiling her moment. I then remembered in Virginia when my treatment was completed, they gave me a bouquet of balloons. That made me very happy and indeed I thought I had 'beat' it and would never have to look at those women again. The only thing I think now is that I am glad the balloons were quiet and did not bother those women who were there with terminal disease knowing that their balloons were never going to arrive.</p>

    <h2>Viruses Killing Cancers: What You Need to Know</h2>
    <h3>March 9th, 2015</h3>

    <p>Lots of folks have asked me about the HBO/VICE documentary that was recently on television. Three physician researchers were interviewed along with three patients who had their cancers "cured" by reengineering viruses  and using them to "attack" and kill three different types of cancers. The cold virus used to 'cure' a brain tumor, the measles virus to 'cure' multiple myeloma and the HIV virus to 'cure' leukemia. (I have placed a link to the documentary at the bottom of this post.)</p>

I know it sounds like science fiction but the physicians come from world renowned institutions: the Mayo Clinic, MD Anderson Cancer Center and the University of Pennsylvania. And indeed it appears they are on to something. But here is the rub: shows like these tend to be highly sensational - they're meant to be and I get that. If it doesn't sound interesting or provocative who is going to watch, right? But I worry for all those thousands out there who are out of options and are looking for a cure.  They are desperate for their loved ones. I guess you could say it grieves me because the likelihood of this methodology being used in the near future isn't probable though the documentary approaches it as if it is.



<strong>Here are a few things which the program didn't discuss:</strong>

<ul>

	<li>the researchers are talking about very small numbers of patients who have been cured using this method; there would need to be thousands more subjects to truly say they had found something that worked; one of the researchers at the American Cancer Society said that curing individuals versus curing cancer are two entirely different things</li>

	<li>there are no long term outcomes yet; the subjects may all get cancer again</li>

	<li>the cancers that were discussed were mostly  "liquid" cancers not solid cancers like breast, lung and colon cancer</li>

	<li>patients and families across the country may get their hopes up too high, thinking that there is an imminent cure for whatever type of cancer they have</li>

</ul>

I wanted to show you something that astounded me - just to drive a point home. The alphabetized list below is a list ONLY of drugs A-D that were once on the market and then later withdrawn by the FDA.  This means that  after the public began using them, they were shown to be dangerous (examples being liver toxicity, cardiac toxicity). I know I am being dramatic but I wanted to show you a very partial list of drugs that went through all the clinical trials required and were approved by the FDA and then withdrawn. Linking this back to the topic at hand, while I agree this is an exciting topic to think about and discuss, all the answers are not known yet in which to determine its efficacy. Please don't think I am a naysayer. I'm right along with everybody hoping for a cure as I sure do need one. But the nurse in me is cautionary and I feel I must show the other side of the coin.

  <h2>My Friends at the Social Security Office</h2>
  <h3>March 10th, 2015</h3>

  <p>Lest you think that my interactions with government officials ended with my experience last year with the TSA lady, you would be wrong. I wish you weren't ...For those of you who are not aware, like many people across the country, I am on social security disability - based on diagnosis and prognosis, I get a small paycheck every month. And as you would expect, there are governmental constraints associated with this payment. One is that if you want to 'try' to return to work, you may do so for a certain number of months and then when you reach that limit, you can continue to work as long as the earnings are not "substantial." So as many of you know, last year I worked from home and did some teaching at the hospital and tried to keep my hours down.</p>

<h2>Last Week</h2>

As the new year rolled around, I received a January check but not February. "Oh, no," I thought, "Here we go again." And sure enough off we went. Luckily the social security department is two blocks away (I told you Corning was golden!) and I walked there last week, took a number and settled in for a long wait. Sure enough, they didn't disappoint! When my number was called, I went up to a very public window in front of the world and queried about my missing check. It doesn't take much to befuddle. The kind lady printed out reams of paper about me (I can only imagine what she learned) and then said she had no idea. She then put a call into Albany and told me to sit back down.

I sat back down and watched the TV screen scroll through a myriad of governmental notices in Spanish. I tried to make a game of how many words I could translate on my own. But when they began to use a large white cat with big blue eyes to explain something about social security, I couldn't make sense of it. Who was that cat supposed to represent? Obama? Me? Then my number was called again.

The nice lady told me that "they" were still trying determine my eligibility for 2015. Did they know something that I did not? Did something in that ream of paper she printed tell her that I had been cured of cancer? Had I gotten some virus while sitting in a room full of coughing, sneezing people that targeted my cancer and now I was healed? Alas, I was told to go home and call Albany.

<h2>Back Home and Then Back Again</h2>

Albany told me that I was now approved for 2015 and that a (late) check would be deposited in my bank within a week. I thanked her and the next day I looked online because that's just the way I am and do you know what I found? Two checks deposited! You would have thought I would have been thrilled but all I could think about was having to trek back to that office and off I went. The nice lady continued to be befuddled. Another call to Albany. Then the answer: you have been paid late for one check and early for another so you are ahead until April. <em>What?</em> I thanked her and as I left, because it is a public arena for all to hear, on old farmer looked up at me and said," You can't make this stuff up!" I told him it had to be the new math and I couldn't understand a word she said.

<h2>Yesterday</h2>

Is it over? Not hardly. A few days later, I looked in my bank account again and guess what? Another check!! <em>What? A third trip back to the SS office?</em> I began to think this was my oncologist's sneaky way to get me up and out and walking on frozen sidewalks. Back I went. The same lady stood at the same open window. I knew the drill. I signed in, took my number and sat down. What I haven't told you to this point is that there is an armed sheriff who works there - just sitting waiting on one of us to go postal I guess...and I can understand why. And there she sat. Suddenly chemo drug kicked me in my stomach and I had to make a quick judgment: hold it in and hope my number was called quickly or lose my place in line and beg the armed guard for a bathroom. Chemo wins every time. What I didn't expect was for her to escort me to the bathroom and stand guard while I used it. Was I being protected or being guarded?

Walking back with my personal sheriff, I thanked her and told her sometimes chemo sneaks up on me. Then without warning, she smiled and started to tell me about her mother who is on an oral chemo for lung cancer and said, "You know that woman never smoked a day in her life." I told her I was sorry. She then rested her hand on her revolver and asked me if I had been "living clean." Crap, I thought. What does she mean? I divulged, "I have never smoked either." And left it at that. Whew...

Soon my number was called and when I told the nice lady  I had received another check, she told me she knew and tried to explain the above scenario. No, I told her, a third check. And I handed her a personal check to cover the one I had just gotten. Well, I about blew her mind.  She started tapping on that computer, paper starting spewing out of her printer. Oh glory. All I wanted to do was run home and put my head under my pillow. She told me there were no notes about this check and if I gave it to her it might mess things up. (Oh, I thought, no lady, if I KEEP this check, it will mess things up.) She fretted and fretted and then finally took my check and sighed.

As I was trying to get away quickly lest she change her mind, the sheriff called me over and said, "You look so young to have cancer. But you know what? You look great." And as I pushed open the door, she yelled, "Keep eating healthy!" Oh my...</p>

    <h2>Tears of Laughter: Good for the Soul</h2>
    <h3>March 11th, 2015</h3>

    <p>So I called Momma yesterday and forgot it was her "flower shuttle" day where a group of people get together, design small flower arrangements and  then take them to nursing homes. Don't you think that is a cool idea? I love flowers at my bedside and can only imagine the positive impact that small gesture has.  It has been a nice way for Mom to integrate into a new community. She was driving home when I called so I knew she wanted me to read that day's blog. It's just our routine. She drives. I read. But on the funny post days (well at least I think they are funny) I am always worried she might drive off into a ditch. So far so good. But it reminds me of one day many years ago when we were out shopping. I was the one driving and she looked over at me and said, "Look at this picture." When I looked down, I wasn't prepared for what I saw. There was my mother and a friend riding a mechanical bull. One hand on the saddle, one hand up in the air and a look of startle on her face. I started laughing uncontrollably; I started crying and then I couldn't see the road. Looking back now, I don't think I have ever laughed any harder than that afternoon. Why would she endanger our lives like that?</p>

There was my mother with a little red bandana tied just so around her neck. She was wearing a cowboy hat. It had to be borrowed. Heaven knows she doesn't wear one in NC. But the funniest thing was, if you looked really closely you could see she was in a nice pair of dress flats which to me made it all the funnier. I think she must have been at a conference of some sort, knowing we don't have 10-gallon hats or mechanical bulls in Winston-Salem. The one thing you can say about my mother is that she is a good sport.

Fast forward to two years ago, we were sitting in Mom's den  - my son, Dad, sister and Mom - one Sunday afternoon sorting through piles of old pictures and wouldn't you know that bull photo rose to the top of the heap. My sister started giggling, she handed it to me and I started giggling. The room was soon awash in laughter. Mom is so tiny, that bull so outrageously gigantic and the look on her face was, "How did I get up here?"

Unbeknownst to either of us, while siting at the beach last summer, that same darn picture came up in conversation. I had secretly taken a picture of it on my phone and once my sister started talking about it, I jauntily pulled it out to show her. She just raised one eyebrow, whipped out her phone and showed me her own copy. Mom just rolled her eyes. She is after all, a very good sport.</p>

    <h2>Four of Us</h2>
    <h3>March 13th, 2015</h3>

    <p>I had just finished my morning devotional and was thinking how relevant it was when the phone rang. The devotional today was teaching the reader to learn to live above one's circumstances and that "trouble and distress are woven into the very fabric of this perishing world..." The verse today for reflection was, "So with you: Now is your time of grief, but I will see you again and you will rejoice and no one will take away your joy John 16:22.

    So the phone. It was Mom. She had just learned of a close family member who was rushed to the hospital yesterday, healthy up until that point. This relative was told yesterday that there is metastatic cancer in the brain. I was stunned. I am stunned. This family member, to his/her knowledge never knew he/she had cancer to begin with.

    So as I write, I have had three calls since Christmas of three fairly young family members all of whom have been given a diagnosis of cancer. All of them completely out of the blue. Multiple pockets of our family shocked beyond belief. If you add me, that makes four. I am very sad today. Not for me as much as for them. All four of us live so far from each other. My dream would be to magically jet to each one and tell them that I love them and how much they mean to me and to read the above scripture to them. I want them to know that this life is brief, like a mist, the Bible says that comes and then quickly goes. And that the unseen world, heaven, is just around the bend for all of us. Not the four of us, ALL of us.

    I remember being told many years ago that our lives are like weavings of cloth. We live underneath that cloth and see all the knots and stray threads. God is above that fabric and only sees the perfect design. When we die, we will be able to rise above our circumstances as the devotion says and we will finally be able to see that beautiful tapestry landscape.

    I am praying for my three beloved relatives. Would you say a prayer for them too?</p>

    <h2>The Butterfly Effect</h2>
    <h3>March 17th, 2015</h3>

    <p>Am I the only one who has never heard of this phenomenon? Probably. But at any rate it is both  scientific  and sociological. The scientific effect states that theoretically the flutter of a butterfly's wings here could in theory disrupt hurricanes way over there on the other side of the world. Wild notion, right? I can't speak much more to this concept - it is all over the internet if you want to read scientific theory, but I would like to spend the rest of the time on the sociological aspect.



    Did you see the program over the weekend that showcased a man who is living and dying with ALS? He is from my home state of NC and loves a krispy kreme donut as only a southerner can. I will let you watch  this video and have him explain to you what he did to start his butterfly effect. I was in awe. And I want to do the same. I bet you will too...

    <h2>God (and Crows) are Funny</h2>
    <h3>March 18th, 2015</h3>

    <p><span style="color: #008080;">Below is an article that I fell in love with when I read it recently. I have no other reason than that to share it with you now. I have always wanted a crow to drop treasures near me about as much as I want my own hedgehog and you  know how much I want that. If I had to choose between the two, I am not sure which way the vote would go. Maybe it's good thing I don't have to decide.</span>



    &nbsp;



    What if we could be friends with wild birds? Seattle-native Gabi Mann seems to have achieved that goal with one of the smartest species on the planet: the American Crow. Never mind that she’s only 8-years old. This imaginative kid has a unique relationship with her neighborhood corvids, as told in a story by the <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-31604026">BBC News Magazine</a>.



    It all started two years ago, when Gabi began feeding local flocks of crows. At first it was haphazard—a dropped chicken nugget here, a crumb from a sandwich there. But the crows took notice, and soon enough Gabi’s hospitality went from being accidental to intentional. These days, Gabi’s crows perch nearby whenever she’s outside, hoping for a feast or even just a morsel. But the spirit of giving inhabits both the girl and the beast. Soon enough, the crows were showering Gabi with all sorts of loot.



    Every day, Gabi leaves out food (mostly peanuts, which are a big hit) in the backyard for her groupies. In return, they leave her gifts—shiny baubles like polished sea-glass, and odder trinkets, like a rusty screw or tube of chapstick. In what could have been a coincidence or a lovely curiosity, the crows promptly returned a lens cap that Gabi had lost while taking some photographs (of a bird, naturally) in an alleyway. And so the plot thickened.



    Crows, and all other members of the corvid family (which also includes jays, magpies, and ravens), are renowned for their intelligence. They’re known to be <a href="http://io9.com/the-mysterious-tool-making-culture-shared-by-crows-and-1460350033">prodigious tool-users</a>, and are more adept with tools than all other animals short of the great apes. Even their social behavior mirrors ours in some ways; they’ve been observed performing <a href="https://www.audubon.org/news/a-funeral-crows">funeral rites</a> for their deceased members of their murder (it’s the name for a group of crows—not sinister at all!).



    Gift-giving isn’t uncommon among crows; <a href="http://www.sefs.washington.edu/SFRPublic/People/FacultyProfile.aspx?PID=10">John Marzluff</a>, a professor of wildlife science at the University of Washington who studies the relationship between crows and people, said in an interview with the BBC, “I can't say they always will [give presents], but I have seen an awful lot of things crows have brought people." (Dead birds are one grisly example.) Sometimes those gifts aren’t entirely welcome: Gabi’s mother once had to throw out a rotting crab claw that the crows had so lovingly bestowed upon her daughter. But Gabi doesn’t seem to be perturbed by the oddities she receives; she keeps all her gifts carefully labeled and stored, treasuring them like precious jewels. "You may take a few close looks," she said to the BBC reporter, "but don't touch."</p>

    <p>For some, this will be a difficult video to watch but for those of us who have to look at ourselves every day, it is important for people to understand what we look like after the ravages of surgery. As I have quoted before, Dr. Susan Love, surgeon and advocate for those with metastatic breast cancer, she has said when you have to cut off body parts as a way to treat a disease, it's time to find a better way.

    <h2>Man with Friend Has Cancer: Friend is Going Through a Rough Time</h2>
    <h3>March 20th, 2015</h3>

    <p><span style="color: #008080;">Do you know the publication the <em>Onion</em>? It is <strong>famously known for satire</strong>, wit and can poke at people with the best of them. When I read this "article" a couple of days ago, I lost it. Many have felt this way when listening to friends of those with cancer despair of "their" hardship. This will make Friday funny for you, I hope!</span>

    BISMARCK, ND—Three months ago, Mark Sennis received the news that everyone dreads: Ben Murphy, a friend and coworker with whom he "occasionally went out to lunch," had been diagnosed with cancer.

    Sennis, who has been suffering from having a friend with cancer since July.

    "You never think you're going to be the one," Sennis said. "At first, I remember thinking, 'How can this be happening to me? What have I done to deserve to have a friend with cancer?'"

    Sennis, who has known Murphy since they started working in the same department at Motorola in 2003, said having a friend with cancer is "a life-altering experience."

    "People ask me how I'm doing, and I say, 'I'm scared and I'm angry,'" Sennis said. "Unless you've personally experienced the pain and hardship that comes with having a coworker you're fairly close to get cancer, you wouldn't understand."

    Sennis said that, while it initially seemed like "life had come to an end," he "made the decision to keep living."

    "One thing I've learned in all this is that life goes on," Sennis said. "Well, maybe not for Ben. But for me. The only thing I can do is take it one day at a time."

    Sennis said he doesn't want people feeling sorry for him.

    "A lot of my friends start to say 'I have a friend who's just been fired,' or 'I have a friend who tore a tendon,'" Sennis said. "Then, they realize that I have a friend with cancer, and they get quiet, like they think they can't discuss their problems with me anymore. I just want people to treat me like normal."

    Sennis said he wishes he'd appreciated the good times he enjoyed with his friends before he got the news.

    "You never understand what you have until your friend's cancer takes it away," Sennis said. "Like, I used to complain about having to go to Wednesday Wings with the guys from sales, but last week we had to cancel because Ben was getting a bone-marrow biopsy, so I sat at home alone all night."

    "It was a pretty depressing picture," he added.

    Sennis said chemotherapy has been particularly hard for him.

    "Ever since the chemo started, it's been a whole other story," Sennis said. "I had to spend a good part of my Sunday hanging out in the waiting room last week. I was so exhausted I could barely move."

    "Just try finding something decent to eat out there," Sennis added. "I ate a sandwich from the hospital deli, and the bread was, like, Wonderbread, and the turkey tasted terrible, like it was day-old or something."

    Sennis said that, ironically, the presence of Murphy's family made the situation more difficult." I'm going through an emotional time," Sennis said. "Ben's entire family was the last thing I needed at the hospital. Do you realize how hard it is to talk to people you don't know at all?"

    Sennis added: "The hardest part was talking to Ben's girlfriend. I never liked her, but because of Ben, I had to go through these awkward conversations. 'How many more chemo sessions does Ben have?' 'Is Ben keeping down his food?' It was really hard."

    Sennis said his struggle has made him reconsider his relationship with God.

    "I wonder why God would do this to me," Sennis said. "It's like God is punishing me for something by giving cancer to a friend of mine."

    Due to the adversity he has faced, Sennis said he has had to take special care of himself.

    "I don't consider giving up an option," Sennis said. "So, for the past two months, twice a week, I've been treating myself to a massage. It's expensive, but it's the least I can do for myself as I go through this really tough time."

    Added Sennis: "I'm not going to let Ben's cancer beat me."</p>

    <h2>Weekend Update: OBX and Chemo</h2>
    <h3>March 21st, 2015</h3>

    <p>Sometimes I forget that you all are not living inside my mind. My lack of follow-up on where I stand with chemo was never conveyed as a couple of friends gently pointed out to me, so I would like to do that now. On Thursday, I will receive my third "small dose" of chemo and then it will be time once again for scans to see if the reduced dose is having any positive effect on the lesions in my liver. One of the side effects of this chemo, Kadcyla (ado-trastuzumab emtansine), is an increased in liver enzymes. I have that now, a chemo-induced hepatitis if you will, that we are having to watch. It may be the dark horse that stops me from taking this drug at some point even if I want to continue - and with that I am not sure. But to die from liver shutdown due to medication would be adding insult to injury. If that happened, I would be mad. So watch out!

    I am giving my hometown infusion center another try and will be a little more assertive than last time. Though I won't dismantle the bell - ha - I will wear half a patient safety hat and speak up if I see something that should be done, like the 30 minute post-chemo wait and so on. I didn't last time. I know. It's a southern thing that I push against often.

    I am on my last day at the OBX and am nostalgic as always. I love it here and have taken advantage of the warmer weather and actually walked almost every day. I hear it snowed yesterday in Corning so I do need to mentally prepare myself to step back in to winter, at least for a while.

    I went over to my favorite restaurant this week with Mom, the one where I bartended during OBXMAS and saw one of the guys. He had talked to my closest bartender friend, the one who has been wintering it in the keys as a bartender. He is on his way back next week and sent me a message that I am bartending with him one night in May. My reputation precedes me!

    So, all in all a wonderful week. Beloved is here to carry me back north tomorrow on a jet plane. And NY life begins again.</p>

    <h2>OBX With MOM</h2>
    <h3>March 23rd, 2015</h3>

    <p>Although this is being sent from cold, blustery NY I wanted to have  a <em>Momma Monday</em> like I haven't had in a while. Mom came last week this time to stay with me for a couple of days down at the OBX. Since my last "trip and fall" in Corning, Beloved and Mom are conspiring (I think) and won't leave me alone for long.

    You never know what will happen when Mom comes blazing in. She arrived in the afternoon and we messed around as they say in the south until supper time when we went across the street to 'my restaurant.' She walked right up to the bar and slammed her hand on it when she saw one of my guys and yelled out, "Where is Sherri?" Meaning why wasn't I behind the bar. Gary jumped, turned around and then hugged me. Like I say, I'm a local. Ha.

    We were seated at the bar, drinks were poured and we (Gary, Mom and I) all caught up on the news. Another round of drinks were poured, hors oeuvres were ordered and I was at peace with the world. Much later, as the check was  handed to us, Gary remarked that the first round of drinks was on him. Gosh, I love this place.

    The next day was beautiful, sunny with a high of 75. We walked and walked on the beach. Mom has not had the  best luck when looking for seaglass and she set out  to make up for lost time. Keep in mind Beloved walks six miles minimum a day and therefore one would reason that he might very well find a few more treasures than Mom. Undaunted, she kept muttering to the ocean, " I want more...I need a bottle neck." This is a fairly new phenomenon that we have been finding and by dern Momma wanted one too. (It was not to be.)

    But look closely. The woman who has never found glass found a couple of large pieces: one green, one bluish and one brown. Never mind that up in the top corner, she found a purple sand dollar along with a lovely blue crab and a couple of conchs. (I am not counting the feathers that she found. Just not my thing.)

    While she was muttering, she looked down at my legs. It was quite warm remember and I had rolled my pant legs up. She stopped mid-beach and exclaimed, "Boy your legs sure are white!" Like me living in upstate New York hasn't been tough enough this winter she was lamenting my snowy white limbs. "Well, Momma, I have found every time I try and go out to lie in the sun, 12 inches of snow gets in my way."

    She nodded and kept walking ahead of me and I heard her say, "But she always has tanned legs..."

    <strong>Post N</strong><strong>ote:</strong> The next morning she went out on the deck to look at her prizes. When she realized the blue crab had lost its color, she pitched him over the deck into our bushes. Thank the Lord so far she hasn't done that to me, especially with these snow white legs...</p>

    <h2>God Takes Care of Girls and Gulls</h2>
    <h3>March 24th, 2015</h3>

    <p>The next morning after Mom had left with her treasures minus that poor washed out crab, I bundled up and took a walk. The temp had dropped 30 degrees. It wouldn't be a long one. The day before walking with Mom, we had noticed hundreds and I mean hundreds of dead fish up and down the shoreline. Walking without stepping on one was a lot like playing dodge ball. In all my years, I had never seen as many fish - don't know what kind but they were good-sized. I mean, if I were a seagull, I would be thinking this was quite a haul.

    As I walked there were hundreds upon hundreds of sea gulls who must have thought exactly like me. It was a virtual feast for them. No dipping or diving was needed. No hard work to do, just saunter up and down the shoreline with your seagull girlfriend and feast. It made me think of the fishes and loaves story in the Bible, God providing for everyone and everything.

    I shortened my walk and turned back and as I got to the stairs that lead up to our neighborhood, I spotted a set of keys dropped at the first step, still half-way buried in the sand. I suddenly thought of the person who had lost them. Our community is a virtual ghost town. Until Memorial Day, there may be a half a dozen of us who are living there. On the ring was a car key, a house key, and a medallion that mentioned that she (I just assumed she) was a member of some ocean society. I couldn't stand that she was worried. So I prayed, "God. This is going to take a miracle. I wouldn't know where to start. So bring this person to me or somehow help me get these keys back to her."

    On my way back to the house I kept a vigilant watch. I passed no one. I looked for Fords. Only one construction truck. I didn't stop. I went to the community's office but no one was there. I thought if nothing else I would call them and tell them I had keys and walk them over next time it was open.

    I got back to the house, put the keys on the table and kept praying. I took a shower and later went into the kitchen. Looking out my window, I saw what I thought was a locksmith and when I saw him getting ready to take that long thin thing that they jam down the window to release the lock, I realized I had a miracle on my hands!

    I ran out, pajamas and all yelling like a crazy woman, "Did you lose your keys at the beach?" A lovely young woman looked up dumbfounded and yelled that she had. She came running across the field and I met her half way, dropping the keys in her hand. She looked up at me and I said, "I was praying I would find you! And I did." She thanked me and ran back to her car. Another miracle.

    Provision for the gulls and keys for the girl. God is always working, acting and answering...</p>

    <h2>Triple Negative Breast Cancer</h2>
    <h3>March 25th, 2015</h3>

    <p>Many posts ago, we talked about the various types of cancer. What I didn't talk about at the time was something called "triple negative" breast cancer. Today I want to explain what this is. Remember from before we discussed the three fueling agents for tumors: estrogen, progesterone and a protein called Her-2.  If you go on breast cancer websites or Facebook pages you will see women talk about their cancer using these three receptors:  ER PR and Her-2. They will then use + or - for each.  It is a shorthand if you will for those of us who live in this world and for caregivers who determine therapy by these three identifiers. For women who are negative for all three receptors, they are known as being "triple negative." So what does this mean? It means that the common treatments and hormonal therapies that work on the  women who have positive receptors will not work for these women. Chemo, however is still an option.

    According to the National Breast Cancer Foundation, 25% of breast cancers are triple negative. And interestingly it is more common in younger women, African Americans and Hispanics. Although there are many factors to consider,  triple negative breast cancer is considered more aggressive and the likelihood of spread and reoccurrence  is increased.

    There is a website dedicated to<a title="Triple Negative Breast Cancer" href="http://www.tnbcfoundation.org/"> triple negative  breast cancer </a>if you or a loved one is interested in more information.</p>

    <h2>World's Oldest Evidence of Breast Cancer</h2>
    <h3>March 26th, 2015</h3>

    <p>CAIRO (Reuters) - A team from a Spanish university has discovered what Egyptian authorities are calling the world's oldest evidence of breast cancer in the 4,200-year-old skeleton of an adult woman.

    Antiquities Minister Mamdouh el-Damaty said the bones of the woman, who lived at the end of the 6th Pharaonic Dynasty, showed "an extraordinary deterioration".

    "The study of her remains shows the typical destructive damage provoked by the extension of a breast cancer as a metastasis," he said in a statement <span class="aBn" tabindex="0" data-term="goog_1473821248"><span class="aQJ">on Tuesday</span></span>.

    Despite being one of the world's leading causes of death today, cancer is virtually absent in archaeological records compared to other diseases - which has given rise to the idea that cancers are mainly attributable to modern lifestyles and to people living for longer.

    But the finding, along with evidence reported last year by British researchers of metastatic cancer in a 3,000-year-old skeleton found in a tomb in modern Sudan, suggests cancer was around in the Nile Valley in ancient times.

    The anthropological team from the University of Jaen said the Egyptian woman was an aristocrat from Elephantine, the country's southernmost town.

    Her remains were discovered in the necropolis of Qubbet el-Hawa, west of the southern city of Aswan, the ministry said.

    According to the World Health Organization's cancer research agency, new cancer cases rose to an estimated 14 million a year in 2012, a figure seen rising to 22 million within 20 years.
