    <h2>Oh the Many Uses of Barbed Wire</h2>
    <h3>April 1st, 2015</h3>

    <p>It's hard to have a Momma Monday when you no longer hear  from her as much. She has flown the coop and gone back to substitute teaching in her local school system.  I hate it as it really puts a hamper on getting good stuff out of her for the blog. Ha. But she is bound and determined to have some spending money so she can renovate their bonus room into a art studio. Well, not actually the lovely carpeted vaulted ceiling bonus room but the framed in attic adjacent to it - the unfinished, unheated, non-air-conditioned room. Why you might ask? Well, Pop continues to be confused too, "Why don't you use this lovely room?" Because Mom says she would have to rip out the carpet. Dad's response: "Why would anyone rip out perfectly good carpeting if you don't need to?" To which Mom responds, " I don't like the color beige, I never have and you simply don't know how messy  my art is going to get." Pop winks at me as he and I know perfectly well how her kitchen looks after she has gone in to make a meal or maybe simply to pour a cup of coffee. Have you seen that very dramatic commercial of the artist who paints with her hands and fingers flicking and swiping paint all over the canvas and at the end she turns the painting upside down and it is a tiger or tortoise? Well, that's Momma when she's cooking dinner. Granted, she is an excellent cook but holy cow watch out and wear goggles!

    <strong><span style="color: #993366;">Post-publishing note:</span></strong>

    <strong><span style="color: #993366;">Mom loves to edit and since she was not aware of these public service announcements, she asked if I would re-post and embed an example of both the commercial and how I liken her cooking methodology to this artist. My mother - forever my editor...</span></strong>

    https://youtu.be/ia8AdxgSVB8

    So she says the attic "speaks to her" and I don't mean in that hallucinatory way but in that artistic way that mesmerizes. She says that every artist friend who has seen the photos of that space all agree that it speaks to them as well. Hence Mom going back into the trenches of public school teaching so she can design this space just to her liking...all of her energy now substituting except when she is in the yard pulling up those weeds, which I found her doing a couple of weeks ago when I called.

    Mom and Dad had decided to clear out the brush. 70+ years old both of them on a clear Saturday and they are out there ripping up rural Raleigh. Soon they got to some barbed wire that trees and underbrush had over taken and Pop went in to get loppers or clippers to free it from the clutches of the foliage. Mom continued to work and after while when they (I guess) had decided they had earned the right to stop and relax at the end of the day, Pop started gathering up the bits of barbed wire when Mom shouted out, "Jim. Where are you going?" To no one's surprise, he responded he was taking it all to the trash can. Her response? "You are taking that perfectly good barbed wire to the trash?  Come back."

    While Dad made drinks, Mom fashioned a wreath out of it, stuck a bird's nest in it and hung it on their front door. Only some of it she told me. She has tucked away a wad of it for her art projects once her studio is completed. It goes without saying but how could I make this stuff up?</p>

    <h2>Inflammatory Breast Cancer</h2>
    <h3>April 2nd, 2015</h3>

    <p>OK. We have discussed breast cancer that stays inside the breast (in situ). We have discussed breast cancer that leaves the breast (invasive) and we have discussed both triple negative and male breast cancer. One would think that that would about cover it but alas there is one more type to discuss: inflammatory breast cancer.

IBC as it is called can be very sneaky because unlike the others, there is no lump or bump that might catch one's attention. This type of breast cancer infiltrates the skin and lymph nodes (remember lymphatic system is the channels that allows certain fluid to travel through and out the body). Only when the lymphatic system becomes blocked does the woman begin to show symptoms.

So what are the symptoms? It can seem strange but some women describe the area as looking and feeling like an insect bite. It can also look like pitting, the breast may have a reddish hue, the nipple may be inverted. I am going to place below that unusual lemon display so you can see again what these symptoms might look like on breast. Counting from the top, note numbers 4 and 6 and then on the bottom row, numbers 9 and 10.

Inflammatory Breast Cancer is considered an aggressive form of breast cancer. Surgery, radiation, chemotherapy and hormonal treatments are all possibilities to address this disease.

    <h2>Good Friday</h2>
    <h3>April 3rd, 2015</h3>

    <p>I remember a few months ago when I wrote the list of things I believed as a Christian. I wasn't prepared for the number of friends and family who spoke to me about that <a href="http://www.sherrifillipo.com/?p=859">post.</a> Though I have never been one to stand on the corner and evangelize, I don't think anyone who knew me was surprised with what I wrote. But I do have to admit that the diagnosis of terminal breast cancer has been freeing, like those folks who are 80+ years old and just speak their mind. And maybe that is why I thought it was a good time to lay it all out on the line. I really don't remember what sparked that <a title="Women of Faith" href="http://www.sherrifillipo.com/?p=859">post.</a>

    Today though is Good Friday. The day when Jesus was nailed to the cross between two other men and died on that cross as the ultimate penalty for our sins. All of us and all of our sins. Do I really believe that? I absolutely do. I have had people turn to me in discussions and ask if the man on the cross who believed at the final hour would go to heaven. After all he had done. And my answer was and is, yes. Without a doubt. Christ said that He would see him later in paradise.

    I am getting around to my point in a longwinded way. It doesn't matter what you have done. It doesn't matter that you have never gone to church, have never uttered a prayer in your life. If you believe that Christ died on that cross oh so many years ago to save us all from our sins (wrongdoings) and arose again three days later - you will go to heaven. And you will see me there when you arrive.

    As Jewish law was written long ago, there was always a penalty to be paid for sin. It used to be animals. Christ, son of God, came in the flesh as the ultimate sacrifice to pay for your sins and mine (which are as countless as the stars). That is why I am at peace with this disease and this life. As today's devotion states:

    <p style="text-align: center;"><em><span style="color: #008080;">For our light and momentary troubles are achieving for us an eternal glory that outweighs them all. 2 Corinthians 4:17</span></em></p></p>

    <h2>My Silver Girls Came Calling</h2>
    <h3>April 6th, 2015</h3>

    <p>Last weekend, my silver girls (see previous <a href="http://www.sherrifillipo.com/?p=933">post<span style="color: #000000;">)</span></a> came calling from Connecticut bearing gifts of cookies, champagne and the desire to sit and catch up. I love these women (along with the mom of one only because I don't know the mom of the other!)We hadn't seen each other in almost a year? But we picked right up as if no time had passed. I mean we do keep up through texts and emails and the occasional package that they spoil me with. A couple of weeks ago, the silver girl on the left and Beloved's former secretary sent me the cutest hedgehog magnet! They are always sending things that surprise and brighten my day.

I had big plans to take them up to the finger lakes and show off my proud adopted land but they were content to sit amongst Beloved and the cats and just talk. My energy level agreed with that. They also teased me and said they had read enough about my mighty margaritas and basically told me to prove it or shut up! I can't get my mixer that I use at the OBX but thankfully I have discovered one that Wegmans has just started selling and used it. That's what you see us holding in the picture. A very tart margarita but we did pretty well getting them down! If I do say so myself.

Later we went up to Tony's - the hangout on the corner. You know the one and ate prime rib and talked some more - downed it with a great bottle of red wine. Beloved just set back and watched us. He knows them both professionally and as friends. I watched him just smile at our crazy conversations. He knows catching up with Yale and New Haven news is very important to me and I lapped it up like a kitten to milk.

They stayed at our only boutique hotel that is on the second floor of a restaurant. Let's put it this way: you pick up your hotel key from the bartender! The next day we went to the Corning Museum of Glass, an absolutely beautiful museum that sits behind my apartment. They just opened a new $100 million wing three weeks ago. The place is stunning. I know I am biased but if you find your way up here, you must go through it. Ancient glass, Asian glass, it goes on for miles. And the greatest largest gift shop known to man.

They left Sunday morning all too soon. Time just flew by. I am blessed to have them in my family. My turn to get to New Haven. Beloved has promised me a trip in spring/summer. We will pour drinks again and start right back where we left off on Sunday. I am one blessed woman.</p>

    <h2>My Son: Weeks Before Graduating! I am So Happy, So Scared</h2>
    <h3>April 7th, 2015</h3>

    <p>I found myself in a very unusual place today. My son is completing his associate's degree in emergency medical services for which I am infinitely proud. He is my son who had detested school since kindergarten so much so that he got himself kicked out of within the first six weeks. He likes to pride himself on that as he will say, "Just how many people have you ever known to be KICKED OUT OF KINDERGARTEN?" It makes for good dinner party conversation but it still has grieved me so. A beautiful bright boy, now man, who has NEVER seen life the way we have. After the incident of being kicked out, I put him in a small, loving Quaker school for a couple of years until he no longer fit there and the school and I  agreed to part ways. He has his own drum, drummer and beat inside his head and he is happy to be marching along to it - whether it matches anybody else's  beat or not. We took some time off and I homeschooled him. It fit my philosophy and his lifestyle to a T but it was still back 10+ years ago when the support wasn't there for moms who found themselves in that situation. Fast forward to college. He had a few spits and splutters but is in line to graduate this May with a degree in Emergency Medical Services. I could lay my head down on this keyboard and weep for all the difficulties he and I have had through his schooling years. But we have  (almost) done it.

    What we have been burning the midnight oil on is the myriad of ways one applies for an EMT position in NC. Some are online, some are faxed, some you need to show up in person (that could be a couple of hours drive and then apply with pen and paper) and on it goes. I confess my faith falters. NOTHING has come easy for this child of 24. I am enormously proud of him. Today, he went in to the Operating Room to intubate which is part of his clinical requirements and one anesthesiologist whom I know told him he could not. The attending surgeon standing there urged him to go ahead (basically out ranking anesthesia). I am so proud to tell you he intubated a patient with ease and the surgeon told him aloud amidst a half dozen staff what a good job he had done under the pressure (meaning while the anesthesiologist stood there against the decision.) I know them both. I told my son if the surgeon told you that you did a good job, then you have arrived. I have never been prouder. That he did not crumble but stood his ground standing at the LOWEST point on an OR totem pole. And he succeeded. God bless my only child.

    After a full day in the OR, he walked across the street to apply for a full-time position with the hospital's ambulance service. When he had finished, he said his eyeballs were rolling back in their sockets. Which is his way of saying, 'I have had enough. I can't take anymore."  I told him a gold star was on his forehead and that he should relax for the rest of the day.

    Here is my private caveat: I can't let go of my grip of life until I can see him gainfully employed for the first time in his life. Would you pray that he can find a job, move out of his dad's house and start living as an adult? It weighs so heavily on me sometimes I don't know if it's the cancer I feel I am carrying or the burden I carry for him.</p>

    <h2>PET Scans and Summer Plans</h2>
    <h3>April 9th, 2015</h3>

    <p>I don't know what it means when you wake yourself up snoring inside a PET scanner, either that the cancer has made you so fatigued that you will snatch a nap anywhere you can or that you have had so many scans, the inside of a scanner feels like home away from home. At any rate, that's exactly what happened yesterday. Twice. Oh brother. The results came in last night. Remember that my oncologist has reduced my chemo dosage by 2/3 as I couldn't tolerate the side effects. We scanned to see if the small dosage was 1) tolerable and 2) if it was capable of reducing the lesions. The answers: 1.) I don't find it tolerable and 2.) There is still one sizable  lesion on my liver.

    All's to say, I am done. At least for the summer. I just emailed my oncologist that I was taking a summer break from chemo and was headed for the beach. I am sure when she reads it, she will faint. I know her. But she has to understand that quality of life means different things to different people. And Beloved and I have decided I am going to spend most of my summer throwing caution to the wind and getting as dark as I want to. I am going to have nieces and nephews and any and all of my children coming and going as much as they please. I am going to gorge on shrimp and corn-on-the-cob and wear out my margarita shaker.

    So, I suddenly feel like a woman from the '70s who has just burned her bra and is feeling the freedom of rebellion.

    <h2>Lab Anyone?</h2>
    <h3>April 10th, 2015</h3>

    <p>OK. Now I want a dog. I mean since I am headed to the OBX I think I need a DOG. What I want is an old Lab who will walk slowly with me and will give me that look of, "Have we walked enough yet?" To which I will respond, "Yes, love. We have."  And we will turn around and go back home. Can dogs ride in golf carts without falling out? I may have to google that.

    I mean I <strong><em>think</em></strong> I want a dog. I am much more of a cat person but I have always wanted a dog I could throw a ball to on the beach instead of high jacking everybody's else's dog I see. It's kind of pathetic. I try to woo their dog over to see if I can pet it or if I can have a turn at ball tossing.  It's like going up and trying to hold every baby that you see out somewhere. You have to be careful.

    No, I don't want the shedding or the drooling or the dependence. (They do remind me of boys.) But darn it, I really would like to have someone to walk with when Beloved is in NY. And next to a purring cat, there is nothing better than the sound of a thumping tail.

    Anyone know where I can find a sweet old Lab, well-behaved, trained on a leash (sounds like I am writing an ad for a dating website) who is low energy like me?</p>

    <h2>Taming the Back 40</h2>
    <h3>April 13th, 2015</h3>

    <p>So I called Mom on Friday to see what was up and I could tell she was outside. Surprise. "What are you doing?" I asked her. Well, she told me Dad had the week off and they had gone out to Lowe's and bought 1000 pounds of 'fake stone.'  I told her to hold on while I grabbed a pen as I felt a blog post was getting ready to unfold before me. "Well, you can write about this but it's fake stone." And I thought, what difference does that make but told her to keep going. " Well, it's temporary, at least  that is what I am telling Jim."

"Momma, what in the world are you doing with 1000 pounds of stone?"

"FAKE stone."

"OK Momma, fake stone. What are you doing?"

"Well, we are building a temporary fire pit in the back." Huh?

"Mom, why? What for? Do you want to roast marshmallows?"

"Well, I guess you could. But it will be big enough to roast a goat if you wanted to." Huh?

"Jim wants to burn all that brush and all those logs. (Remember her <a title="Chainsaw" href="http://www.sherrifillipo.com/?p=1577">chainsaw</a>? Remember the <a title="barbed wire" href="http://www.sherrifillipo.com/?p=2191">barbed wire</a>?)

"Sherri, (as if she is explaining it to a five year old) we are trying to tame the back woods."

"Mother, you and Dad are going to burn down the neighborhood."

Then she stopped talking to me and started yelling out to Dad, "OK. Hold on a minute!"

"Sherri, he needs me to help him navigate the truck down to the creek. I'll call you back. Go take a nap."

She always tells me to go take a nap nearly every time she talks to me. I don't get it. She is 70+ getting ready to lay 1000 pounds of rock and she wants me to nap.</p>

    <h2>Three Wonderful Men in Corning</h2>
    <h3>April 14th,2015</h3>

    <p>I have been told many times that I should serve on the Chamber of Commerce here because people claim  I am a cheerleader for all things Corning. But I can't help it. I have been loved greatly by so many since arriving to this town. Let me give you another example. For those of you who have been reading along for a while know that I am in love with my hairdresser. I have already posted once about <a title="Dustin" href="%20http://www.sherrifillipo.com/?p=598">him</a> but I need to tell him, his partner and their boss, the owner of the salon, how much they mean to me.

    I was six months into my new home in Corning when cancer came calling again if you remember.  I stumbled into a hair salon, <a title="AJ" href="http://www.ajshairmakeup.com/">AJ's</a>, and unbeknownst to me, started a lifetime friendship with these three men. Dustin has seen me through chemo twice and has shaved my head. He has seen me cry over  a handful of chemo-fried hair and on more than one occasion, he has joined me in tearful grief. I met his partner many months later and fell in love with him right away as well. Between these three men they have man-handled my chemo frizz, cut it, razored it, coaxed it, cursed it but not once given up on it - long after I had.

    You see, these men hold women who have breast cancer, in what I think, is high esteem. It is quite humbling what they are willing to do to make chemo, post-chemo and cancer as manageable as they can for those who are suffering. Yesterday, I went in to have my curls straightened as I am headed to the OBX and for those of you in the south you know what summer weather does to hair. Dustin was very patient in his client education (if only all nurses were this thorough during patient teaching) explaining that with chemo still in my hair strands, there is no certainty what we will come out with - it might decide to curl right up again or not. We both agreed that we were  ready for the adventure and 30 minutes later as he was blowing my lovely straight locks he said, "Oh Miss Sherri! Can you feel how silky smooth your hair is?" Grinning from ear to ear as he flicked that blow dryer back and forth, "You look marvelous!" I am old enough to be his mother and I don't care! I eat it up. When you are 54, you will take any compliment you can get.

    He, his partner and the owner of the salon are the kindest, most warm-hearted three men I have ever known. Having them here in this small town comforts me. When I worried yesterday that I might have a hard time getting an appointment in June, Dustin grinned (he has the loveliest smile) "Oh Miss Sherri. I work between two guys. One says anything you want done inside this salon, to give it to you. The other says anything you want or need in the community  he will make sure you get it." It's hard not to feel like royalty amidst all this love.</p>

    <h2>Rita, Rita, Rita</h2>
    <h3>April 15th, 2015</h3>

    <p>Another celebrity has had a double mastectomy. This time it was Rita Wilson, actor Tom Hanks' better half. She spoke publically this week about her breast cancer stating that she has been followed very closely over the years. After recent breast biopsies, one physician told her she did not have cancer. The first physician diagnosed lobular carcinoma in situ (remember in situ means inside, meaning that it has not broken through its site of origination). Later at the urging of a friend she went and had a second opinion, and was then told she had invasive lobular carcinoma (cancer that has broken through that barrier and is now outside of its site of origination. Wilson's cancer is in the lobes of the breast rather than the more common ducts of the breast. For clarification, according to <a title="breastcancer.org" href="http://www.breastcancer.org/symptoms/types/ilc">breastcancer.org</a>, <em>"Lobular</em> means that the cancer began in the milk-producing lobules (lobular carcinoma), which empty out into the ducts (ductal carcinoma)  that carry milk to the nipple. About 10% of all invasive breast cancers are invasive lobular carcinomas. (About 80% are invasive ductal carcinomas.)"



<a href="http://www.sherrifillipo.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/breast.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1120" src="http://www.sherrifillipo.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/breast.jpg" alt="Diagram of breast cancer" width="500" height="381" /></a>



Here is where it gets sticky for me:

1. Wilson stated that she expects to make a full recovery 'because we caught it early.' Where have we heard that before? Mine was caught early and it is not saving me.

2. She urged women to get second opinions as this is what saved her (see #1). While it is within every woman's right to have a second opinion, it is also wise to speak with your insurance company to confirm that they will pay for a second opinion before you move ahead. According to <a title="The Patient Advocate Foundation" href="http://www.patientadvocate.org/requests/publications/GU-Second-Opinions.pdf">The Patient Advocate Foundation</a>, Medicare will pay for 80% of the cost. Just remember that a second opinion might involve additional blood work or tests that may or may not be covered.

3. Remember <a title="Joan Lunden" href="%20http://www.sherrifillipo.com/?p=783">Joan Lunden </a>stating she was going beat this disease? Rita Wilson no more knows if she will beat it than Joan does.

<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #008080;">Remember, it's the cancer that decides who will beat it, <strong><em>not</em></strong>  the celebrity.</span></p></p>

    <h2>Ending Treatment: A Discussion With My Beloved Oncologist</h2>
    <h3>April 16th, 2015</h3>

    <p>I had a face-to-face discussion on Tuesday with my dear physician. Let's just say I was too choked up to write about it until now. I can't describe how sad we both were. She is so genuine and so lovely and so kind. I tell you, I kept patting her knee telling her it was ok. When we both started crying, she jumped up to find a tissue box but alas there was none so there we sat crying into paper towels. Not a tissue to be found in that exam room.

    What I told her is what I told you several blogs back -  that I was going to the beach and living without the shackles of cancer for the summer. No treatment, no scheduling my trip around chemo days. I was just going to give myself and my family all of my time and my energy. If the reduced chemo had been kinder to me, I might not have come to such conclusions but it hasn't been.

    She said that she knew I understood what I was doing but she articulated it anyway:  the cancer would progress. I confirmed to her that I knew. What surprised me was that she said that she didn't have anything else to offer that wouldn't give me the same issues that I have been dealing with and that's when it hit me just exactly what I had done. I had closed the door. We just looked at each other and started crying again. She said, "I try to at least leave the room before I let a tear fall." I told her I was fine with her crying in front of me, that her genuiness  was what was so lovely about her.

    At the end of the discussion, she asked if she could pray with me. She took my hands, patient and physician, we prayed and cried. We hugged and said good-bye.</p>

    <h2>The Corning "Herald"</h2>
    <h3>April 17th, 2015</h3>

    <p>Maybe it's the terminal disease that has made me schmaltzy. I don't know but here I go again. For those of you not on chemo, let me tell you it can really do a number on your body in ways you couldn't even expect. Some chemos make your nose run for no reason. Yes, I am one of those women who stuffs kleenix up her sleeve as my nose runs like the proverbial faucet. The chemo that I have been on also tears up my fingernails and toenails. My fingers and toes minding their own business get hit with the chemo as well. Doesn't seem fair but cancer is not fair. So when I go and get a pedicure, I feel it is medical management. Well, at least that's what I tell Beloved.

    So today I went to have my feet scrubbed and painted for spring. And this is, again what I love about Corning. We have an older, diminutive gentleman whom I will call Timmy who is challenged in many ways. But he has a job and he does it well in Corning. He is an ambassador (kind of like me but I don't have the spiffy bicycle that he does). Timmy spends his days riding up and down Market Street, our main street through town. He is akin to being a herald - especially if there has been a fire or police chase in the area. Everyone knows him and if you are having lunch somewhere, he might walk in (always wearing his helmet which is more than I can say for my son!) and will greet each customer individually. Whether you are a local or tourist, he does not care. You will get a wave. I find it difficult to understand much of what he says but I have witnessed many local folks who carry on a conversation with him.

    Like today for instance. I was sitting with my feet in a tub of water when Timmy walked in, helmet on, yellow jacket zipped up and he was excited. One woman looked up and said, "Hey Timmy." And Timmy went on about something that I couldn't quite hear. As he made his way down the aisle of women getting pedis and manis, people would greet him. When I waved and said, "Hey Timmy." He started telling me about something with the word four in it. I tried to interpret what he was saying and most times I am pretty good with accents or impediments but not with him. So he worked his way down to the last woman. "Hey Timmy." She called out and then he began his story. I heard her say, "You don't say.  A fire down on 4th street?" She was catching it all and you could see the relief in his eyes that FINALLY someone he could talk to. He was so relieved, he sat down in the pedicure chair beside her, helmet and all and described (I guess) what he had witnessed this morning.

    When he had finally gotten the story out, he walked back to the front where the first woman said, "Timmy. You should visit my mother sometime soon." Timmy nodded and left  the store jumping on his bike to wait for the next exciting moment in Corning. I overheard the lady say that Timmy lives with a relative next door to her mom.

    Only in Corning. Timmy comes in, four women know him by name and a grin never leaves his face.</p>

    <h2>Momma's Bed and Breakfast</h2>
    <h3>April 20th, 2015</h3>

    <p>My mother is nothing if not a good sport, as is my dad. Due to an illness in our family, my parents spent the weekend taking care of my cousin's three children ages around 7, 9, and 11. On Friday night while I was eating pizza and having a gin and tonic, Mom texted me to tell me the youngest, a girl, was standing in the chair where my dad was trying to watch TV and was rubbing his bald head around and around in circles all the while yelling out to my mother, "Hey, Uncle Jane!"

    Saturday morning  I heard Dad made them pancakes with strawberries on top and later that afternoon, I called to make sure the kids had not tied my parents up with rope like in an old sitcom, when Momma said they were outside at........................the fire pit. You know the one, the one with the fake stone? "Mom, what are you doing out there with three kids circling the fire?"

    "Oh, I moved. I'm not near them. You dad is. But I can see them." It made me break out into a nervous sweat 600 miles away. "Mom, what are you doing with them at the pit?"

    "Oh, we're going to cook hotdogs out here for dinner." Being a bit sarcastic,  I asked her would there be marshmallows too? "Oh, yes. Your dad is going up to the store in a minute to get some." Of course he is. He is one good sport. As is she. I urged her to go back there and help him herd those kids and she reminded me in no uncertain terms that she was a retired public school teacher with 30 years of experience under her belt and she could handle it. "Hey, put those leaves down! You are going start a fire....now what were we saying?"

    Sunday morning, she left me a message that all was well. That after dinner  last night, they found a deer track near the creek and they had mixed up some plaster to make a mold of the track. The middle boy was cleaning the dirt off of it and everyone had had a good time. Of course they had. Who wouldn't? At Momma's B&B.</p>

    <h2>The Latest on Mammography: Breast Screening Draft Recommendations</h2>
    <h3>April 21st, 2015</h3>

    <p>The video below from the website <a title="Screening for Breast Cancer" href="http://www.screeningforbreastcancer.org" target="_blank">screeningforbreastcancer.org </a>will no doubt leave some of you upset as the current national belief related to mammography borders on them being life preservers and who wouldn't throw out a life preserver to a woman in need? But as time marches on, researchers, physicians and the public are learning not only about the pros of having mammography but also the cons of having the screening. You have to understand that indeed there are cons. And for many women that is a step that they cannot take. It is counter-intuitive for many.  It is as if we as Americans have had it drummed into our brains that "more is better" whatever we are talking about. Therefore more mammograms, more often must be the safest thing to do.  It just simply is not true.



The video below is about seven minutes and while not dramatic or riveting (no dogs doing cute tricks, no wild car chases) the information that this researcher is providing is what we as a nation needs to hear even if we don't want to. Do you remember recently when Amy Robach from <em>Good Morning America</em> said a mammogram saved her life when they discovered a lump? And the world shook its collective head and said, "See, we told you!" I am telling you as difficult as it sounds, that it isn't that black and white. I blogged about her when she went public and have placed the link here if you want to read it <a title="Mammography, What I Bet You Didn't Know" href="http://www.sherrifillipo.com/?p=748" target="_blank">Mammography, What I Bet You Didn't Know</a>.

    <h2>The Conversation: Part II</h2>
    <h3>April 27th, 2015</h3>

      <p>So much has happened since I took my  respite last week as someone called it. If you remember from about a month ago, I told you of three family members dealing with new diagnoses of cancer (the post entitled <a title="The Four of US" href="http://www.sherrifillipo.com/?p=2051">The Four of Us</a>)  and it is with a heavy heart that I tell you that one of my uncles who was just diagnosed a month ago is now in hospice. Just like that. From working all over the world until last month when he got a bit confused; then a steady and rapid decline since March.

    So while I floated around in the warm waters of Naples, Florida my heart would almost sink me from the heaviness I felt for him, my aunt, and my two cousins (their children). Unlike me, they have not had nearly enough time, in my opinion, to sit and say all they wanted to say. Remember "<a title="The Conversation" href="http://www.sherrifillipo.com/?p=1770">the conversation</a>" I posted recently about how important it is to have those tough conversations prior to something catastrophic happening? I am not saying that my family members have or have not had them but what I know is that I saw my uncle looking healthy at  my elderly uncle's 90th party  (remember the blog about the cute WWII guys) that would have been late January, his diagnosis in March and under hospice care in April. The good thing? My uncle and his entire family have a strong faith and no one in his family will question his eternal home.

    For the last three days I have splashed tears. In the pool. In the airport. In restaurants. For him. For me. For our families. I feel under the circumstances, I must preach this message again to all that read this blog. Whether you are sick like me or not. Start having those conversations about what is important to you in your life. What you would and wouldn't want to happen to you if you suddenly got confused driving to work and found yourself in the hospital with a terminal illness. That quick. In the blink of an eye. If you don't think you can do it without someone facilitating, find a therapist or social worker or someone who can sit with you and a couple of family members and rough draft those things that you  want done, the way you want them done. Remember the book I quoted from recently entitled <em>The Conversation</em>. In it Dr. Volandes said, [pullquote]"80% of Americans want to [die] at home with family and friends free from the institutional grip of hospitals [/pullquote]  "80% of Americans want to [die] at home with family and friends free from the institutional grip of hospitals and nursing homes and in relative comfort. However only 24% older than 65 die at home; 63% die in hospitals or nursing homes, sometimes tethered to machines and often in pain......the discrepancy is largely due to failure of doctors having discussions with patients about how to live life's final chapter.

    <h2>Again, Angels When You Least Expect Them</h2>
    <h3>April 28th, 2015</h3>

    <p>I spent most of my time in Florida at the pool. I have always been a pool rat and could sun, swim and read all day. And that's exactly what Beloved let me do. On Saturday when we were going up to have lunch, I noticed the hotel had set up a massage chair near the pool and I walked over to inquire about the cost. Come to find out they were free 10 minute massages! I signed up on the spot.



    When I was seated, I told the gentleman that due to a childhood spinal fusion, my neck and shoulders were like bricks. He laughed and then later acknowledged that I was right. A few minutes later, he asked where I was from and I told him upstate New York. He was from Buffalo. He said he knew what a cold winter was all about and then inquired what I did in Corning. I told him not much and then got a wee bit teary. Out of nowhere.



    I told him I was a full-time patient with breast cancer. And then blurted out that it was terminal. Before I knew it, do you know what he did? He cupped his hand to my ear and whispered, "Sherri, God is in control." I was amazed. I told him indeed He was. We finished our time together. My neck felt so much better.



    When I stood up, he looked at me and said, "I will see you there [heaven]" and gave me the most beautiful smile ever. I started dropping tears and he hugged me. I walked away and thought, I didn't see that angel coming.</p>

    <h2>Maintaining Focus</h2>
    <h3>April 29th, 2015</h3>

    <p>I must say between my uncle's decline, my son pushing through his last few weeks of school and me trying to pack a summer's worth of things to drive to NC (alone) my faith has really been put to the test. And I will be the first one to tell you, lest Beloved beat me to the punch, that I have not done such a swift job in the last few days. You see, I like things done on my schedule and for the most part in an orderly fashion. And when things go like that, I can be pretty nice. But I feel like I have been in a blender even though I just got back from four lovely days in sunny Florida. And sometimes when I have to put my faith into action,  I can lose it. And it humbles me. It reminds me that I am NOT "all that and a bag of chips" as the kids say.



    I am irritable and stressed out and if I could, I would leap right out of my skin and it makes me crazy that I can't get a grip under my own power. Do I slow down and "be still" as the scripture says? Oh no. I have too much to do. (Please. That sounds so stupid but that's internally how I am feeling.)



    But late today, I remembered something I read this week about a ballerina. From the devotional I keep quoting Sarah Young , the author, reminded me, "Just as a spinning ballerina must keep returning her eyes to a given point to maintain her balance, so you must keep returning your focus to [Christ]."



    And it dawned on me. I had been doing just the opposite and that's why I have been so dizzy and out of control.</p>
