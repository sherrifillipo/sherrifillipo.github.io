    <h2>African American Women and Breast Cancer</h2>
    <h3>June 1st, 2015</h3>
    <p>Friday I wrote about young women and breast cancer. Today I want to share some information on this disease as it pertains to African American women. There is  a great website to help answer more specific questions and it is called <a href="http://www.sistersnetworkinc.org/breastcancerfacts.html">Sisters Network, Inc.</a> Founded in 1994, the website says it is a leading voice and the only national African American Breast Cancer survivorship organization in the United States. According to the American Cancer Society African American 2013-1014 Cancer Facts (as stated in this website) it notes some very serious information about this disease as it relates to this population:</p>

    <blockquote>Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer among African American women. An estimated 27,060 new cases of breast cancer [was] expected to occur among African American women in 2013.

    Among younger women (under age 45), the mortality rate of breast cancer is higher in African Americans than in whites. The median age of diagnosis is 57 years for African American women, compared to 62 years for white women.

    Breast cancers diagnosed in African American women are more likely to have factors associated with poor prognosis, such as higher grade, advanced stage, and negative hormone (estrogen [ER] and progesterone [PR]) receptor status, than those diagnosed in white women. Furthermore, premenopausal African American women in particular appear to have a higher risk for <a href="http://www.sherrifillipo.com/?p=2147">triple-negative </a>(ER negative, PR negative, and  human epidermal growth factor receptor [HER] 2 negative) and basal-like breast cancers, which are distinct but overlapping aggressive subtypes of breast cancer that are associated with shorter survival.

    The 5-year relative survival rate for breast cancer diagnosed in 2002 - 2008 among African American women was 78%, compared to 90% among whites. This difference can be attributed to both later stage at detection and poorer stage-specific survival among African American women.

    Only about half (51%) of breast cancers diagnosed among African American women are diagnosed at a local stage, compared to 61% among white women.

    Within each stage, 5-year survival is also lower among African American women than whites overall (60% versus 69%).</blockquote>

    These statistics are incredibly sobering. I hope you will share this website with friends, family and co-workers who may benefit from this information and the support this website can give.</p>

<h2>Ashkenazi Jewish Women and Breast Cancer</h2>
<h3>June 2nd, 2015</h3>

<p>A young Jewish woman seen above, Rochelle Shoretz, died on Sunday from metastatic breast cancer. Ms. Shoretz's heritage is of Ashkenazi descent, which made her more susceptible to both breast and ovarian cancer. Studies that were conducted in 1994 and 1995 showed a gene mutation that posed an increased risk for breast cancer. In 1995 and in 1996, DNA studies revealed that Ashkenzai Jews are ten times more likely to have these gene mutations, known now as BRCA1 and BRCA2, than the general population.

Ms. Shoretz was originally diagnosed in 2001 and at the time wished that she could talk to women who were like her and founded the group <a href="http://www.sharsheret.org/">Sharsharet </a>which in Hebrew means "chain." This website offers a wealth of information and support not only for young Jewish women who are living with breast cancer but women at any age living with this disease. The site offers educational material, events, and support groups.

In 2009, Ms. Shoretz's  cancer returned and on Sunday she died at the age of 42.

    <h2>Feeling Ephemeral</h2>
    <h3>June 3rd, 2015</h3>

    <p><h4> Yesterday</h4>

    I woke up at 4:00 this morning and thought of the word "ephemera." I know, it sounds so hoity-toity but it's not. It is a cool word I learned a long time ago -  that I have loved since I read the definition though it has changed through the ages. It started out meaning something that is here for a while and then gone, something  transitory. It has evolved to become more about things made of paper which are not supposed to last forever - like a theater ticket.

    Why would I wake up from a sound sleep and think of that word? Well, I have been ruminating about that all day.  Counting today, I have had three what I call "low" days. I can't quite explain why except for the glaringly obvious. I have been listless. I haven't gotten out of my pajamas and haven't felt like going out or talking to anyone. I am still back in Corning and have to admit, that the thought of returning to the OBX soon feels so daunting to me as I write. How opposite to how I was feeling a month ago, right? I get the contradiction. But I don't fully understand why.

    A month or so ago, it was still quite cold here. I mean three inches of snow fell Easter Sunday and I think at the time, I couldn't wait for warmth. But in actuality, summer has never been my time of the year. Heat and I do not mix. Never have. Add a couple of flights of stairs (inside and outside the beach house, never mind the mountain of stairs at the beach to get down to the water) and I feel like I cannot handle it. That I am much more comfortable and safe here in my little apartment.

    Ephemeral? That's how I am feeling today. Like tissue paper or cotton candy.

    <h4>This morning</h4>

    I woke up this morning with a cat lying next to me thinking that I might have a better day today. The sun is trying to come out through the fog. That is sort of how I feel.  I have opened the terrace door and the other cat is lying half-way in half-way out. Maybe that is a picture of me as well. Lest you think I am always "up" and happy. This should balance out those thoughts.]]></p>

    <h2>Lesbian and Bisexual Women and Breast Cancer</h2>
    <h3>June 4th, 2015</h3>

    <p>I cannot tell you how much I learn when writing this blog. Today is a good example of that.  From the <a href="http://www.cancer.org/healthy/findcancerearly/womenshealth/cancer-facts-for-lesbians-and-bisexual-women">American Cancer Society</a>, note these statistics about lesbian and bisexual women as it relates to breast cancer:

    <blockquote>Studies have found that lesbians and bisexual women have higher rates of breast cancer than heterosexual women. They also get less routine health care than other women, including colon, breast, and cervical cancer screening tests. Some of the reasons for this include:

    <ul>

    	<li><strong>Low rates of health insurance:</strong> Many health insurance policies don’t cover unmarried partners. This makes it harder for many lesbians and bisexual women to get quality health care. Many states now offer family health insurance plans that may help you get coverage in other ways.</li>

    	<li><strong>Fear of discrimination:</strong> Many women don’t tell their doctors about their sexual orientation, because they don’t want discrimination to affect the quality of health care they receive. This can make it harder to have a comfortable relationship with a provider. A lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender/transsexual (LGBT) community center or group may be able to refer you to LGBT-friendly health care providers (see below).</li>

    	<li><strong>Negative experiences with health care providers:</strong> Fear of having a negative experience with a health care provider can lead some women to delay or avoid medical care, especially routine care such as early detection tests. Missing routine cancer screening tests can lead to cancer being diagnosed at a later stage, when it’s harder to treat. Today, there are many LGBT-friendly providers. Don’t give up – find the respectful care you deserve!</li>

    </ul>

    </blockquote>

    There is a national website, the <a href="http://www.cancer-network.org/cancer_information/lesbians_and_cancer/lesbians_and_breast_cancer.php">National LGBT Cancer Network </a> which questions the research that has been done to date to draw a lot of conclusions citing that the numbers of lesbians and bisexual women studied have been too small. This website uses the phrase "cluster of risk factor theory" stating the four most-cited cancer risk factors in the research on lesbians and breast cancer risk are:

    <blockquote>

    <ul>

    	<li>   <strong>Cigarette smoking</strong> - data suggest that lesbians smoke cigarettes at a substantially higher rate than heterosexual women.</li>

    	<li>   <strong>Alcohol use</strong> - some research reports higher rates of heavy drinking among lesbians than heterosexual women</li>

    	<li><strong>   Obesity</strong> - some studies report that lesbians are more likely to be overweight or have a Body Mass Index (BMI) over 25.</li>

    	<li>   <strong>Pregnancy</strong> - lesbians are less likely to have biological children before age 30, which would offer some protection against cancer.</li>

    </ul>

    </blockquote>

Dr. Love as you may recall has written The Breast Book, a comprehensive and highly readable  book on every aspect of breast cancer. She is completing her 6th edition and should be on the market in the near future.]]></p>

    <h2>Tattooing Ink Can Cause PET Scan Misdiagnoses: Did You Know?</h2>
    <h3>June 8th, 2015</h3>

    <p>This article is from CBS news. I have never heard of this phenomenon and wanted to share it with you.</span></h3>

    <a href="http://www.sherrifillipo.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/tattoo.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2660 aligncenter" src="http://www.sherrifillipo.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/tattoo.jpg" alt="Girl tattoo artist works on the client" width="424" height="283" /></a>

    <strong>ORANGE, Calif. -</strong><strong>-</strong> A woman with cancer had a major scare after ink from her tattoos caused an imaging test to light up, leading her doctor to believe the disease had spread.

    Dr. Ramez Eskander, an Orange County surgeon, told CBS Los Angeles that ink from his patient's tattoos, which covered her legs and thighs, had lit up her lymph nodes on a body-image test called a PET scan.

    The images led doctors to believe her cervical cancer had spread to her lymph nodes.

    But once in the operating room, doctors learned it was tattoo ink causing the bright spots on her scan -- not cancer cells.

    "When you tattoo, some of that ink will be absorbed in the cells in the lymphatic system and migrate to levels of lymph nodes," he said.

    Eskander published his findings this week in the <em>Journal of Obstetrics &amp; Gynecology</em>. He says the patient's case should serve as a warning to people with body art and their doctors.

    "What we wanted to do is educate physicians, patients, families," he said. "When there is a PET scan that shows a bright lymph node, if a patient has significant tattoos or body art, then you have to be cognizant that these might be false positives."

    In this woman's case, she still received a hysterectomy because she did have cervical cancer. However, because it had not spread as originally thought, she did not need to undergo radiation, which can have lifelong side effects.

    "She was thrilled to share her story with everyone, but she never indicated she regretted the tattoos," Eskander said.

    Eskander hopes his study creates a conversation about early detection and prevention, and says the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine and exams are the key to that for cervical cancer.

    Researchers were not able to determine exactly how much tattoo ink is needed to cause a misdiagnosis from a scan.</p>
