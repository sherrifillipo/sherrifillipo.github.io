    <h2>African American Women and Breast Cancer</h2>
    <h3>June 1st, 2015</h3>
    <p>Friday I wrote about young women and breast cancer. Today I want to share some information on this disease as it pertains to African American women. There is  a great website to help answer more specific questions and it is called <a href="http://www.sistersnetworkinc.org/breastcancerfacts.html">Sisters Network, Inc.</a> Founded in 1994, the website says it is a leading voice and the only national African American Breast Cancer survivorship organization in the United States. According to the American Cancer Society African American 2013-1014 Cancer Facts (as stated in this website) it notes some very serious information about this disease as it relates to this population:</p>

    <blockquote>Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer among African American women. An estimated 27,060 new cases of breast cancer [was] expected to occur among African American women in 2013.

    Among younger women (under age 45), the mortality rate of breast cancer is higher in African Americans than in whites. The median age of diagnosis is 57 years for African American women, compared to 62 years for white women.

    Breast cancers diagnosed in African American women are more likely to have factors associated with poor prognosis, such as higher grade, advanced stage, and negative hormone (estrogen [ER] and progesterone [PR]) receptor status, than those diagnosed in white women. Furthermore, premenopausal African American women in particular appear to have a higher risk for <a href="http://www.sherrifillipo.com/?p=2147">triple-negative </a>(ER negative, PR negative, and  human epidermal growth factor receptor [HER] 2 negative) and basal-like breast cancers, which are distinct but overlapping aggressive subtypes of breast cancer that are associated with shorter survival.

    The 5-year relative survival rate for breast cancer diagnosed in 2002 - 2008 among African American women was 78%, compared to 90% among whites. This difference can be attributed to both later stage at detection and poorer stage-specific survival among African American women.

    Only about half (51%) of breast cancers diagnosed among African American women are diagnosed at a local stage, compared to 61% among white women.

    Within each stage, 5-year survival is also lower among African American women than whites overall (60% versus 69%).</blockquote>

    These statistics are incredibly sobering. I hope you will share this website with friends, family and co-workers who may benefit from this information and the support this website can give.</p>

<h2>Ashkenazi Jewish Women and Breast Cancer</h2>
<h3>June 2nd, 2015</h3>

<p>A young Jewish woman seen above, Rochelle Shoretz, died on Sunday from metastatic breast cancer. Ms. Shoretz's heritage is of Ashkenazi descent, which made her more susceptible to both breast and ovarian cancer. Studies that were conducted in 1994 and 1995 showed a gene mutation that posed an increased risk for breast cancer. In 1995 and in 1996, DNA studies revealed that Ashkenzai Jews are ten times more likely to have these gene mutations, known now as BRCA1 and BRCA2, than the general population.

Ms. Shoretz was originally diagnosed in 2001 and at the time wished that she could talk to women who were like her and founded the group <a href="http://www.sharsheret.org/">Sharsharet </a>which in Hebrew means "chain." This website offers a wealth of information and support not only for young Jewish women who are living with breast cancer but women at any age living with this disease. The site offers educational material, events, and support groups.

In 2009, Ms. Shoretz's  cancer returned and on Sunday she died at the age of 42.

    <h2>Feeling Ephemeral</h2>
    <h3>June 3rd, 2015</h3>

    <p><h4> Yesterday</h4>

    I woke up at 4:00 this morning and thought of the word "ephemera." I know, it sounds so hoity-toity but it's not. It is a cool word I learned a long time ago -  that I have loved since I read the definition though it has changed through the ages. It started out meaning something that is here for a while and then gone, something  transitory. It has evolved to become more about things made of paper which are not supposed to last forever - like a theater ticket.

    Why would I wake up from a sound sleep and think of that word? Well, I have been ruminating about that all day.  Counting today, I have had three what I call "low" days. I can't quite explain why except for the glaringly obvious. I have been listless. I haven't gotten out of my pajamas and haven't felt like going out or talking to anyone. I am still back in Corning and have to admit, that the thought of returning to the OBX soon feels so daunting to me as I write. How opposite to how I was feeling a month ago, right? I get the contradiction. But I don't fully understand why.

    A month or so ago, it was still quite cold here. I mean three inches of snow fell Easter Sunday and I think at the time, I couldn't wait for warmth. But in actuality, summer has never been my time of the year. Heat and I do not mix. Never have. Add a couple of flights of stairs (inside and outside the beach house, never mind the mountain of stairs at the beach to get down to the water) and I feel like I cannot handle it. That I am much more comfortable and safe here in my little apartment.

    Ephemeral? That's how I am feeling today. Like tissue paper or cotton candy.

    <h4>This morning</h4>

    I woke up this morning with a cat lying next to me thinking that I might have a better day today. The sun is trying to come out through the fog. That is sort of how I feel.  I have opened the terrace door and the other cat is lying half-way in half-way out. Maybe that is a picture of me as well. Lest you think I am always "up" and happy. This should balance out those thoughts.]]></p>

    <h2>Lesbian and Bisexual Women and Breast Cancer</h2>
    <h3>June 4th, 2015</h3>

    <p>I cannot tell you how much I learn when writing this blog. Today is a good example of that.  From the <a href="http://www.cancer.org/healthy/findcancerearly/womenshealth/cancer-facts-for-lesbians-and-bisexual-women">American Cancer Society</a>, note these statistics about lesbian and bisexual women as it relates to breast cancer:

    <blockquote>Studies have found that lesbians and bisexual women have higher rates of breast cancer than heterosexual women. They also get less routine health care than other women, including colon, breast, and cervical cancer screening tests. Some of the reasons for this include:

    <ul>

    	<li><strong>Low rates of health insurance:</strong> Many health insurance policies don’t cover unmarried partners. This makes it harder for many lesbians and bisexual women to get quality health care. Many states now offer family health insurance plans that may help you get coverage in other ways.</li>

    	<li><strong>Fear of discrimination:</strong> Many women don’t tell their doctors about their sexual orientation, because they don’t want discrimination to affect the quality of health care they receive. This can make it harder to have a comfortable relationship with a provider. A lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender/transsexual (LGBT) community center or group may be able to refer you to LGBT-friendly health care providers (see below).</li>

    	<li><strong>Negative experiences with health care providers:</strong> Fear of having a negative experience with a health care provider can lead some women to delay or avoid medical care, especially routine care such as early detection tests. Missing routine cancer screening tests can lead to cancer being diagnosed at a later stage, when it’s harder to treat. Today, there are many LGBT-friendly providers. Don’t give up – find the respectful care you deserve!</li>

    </ul>

    </blockquote>

    There is a national website, the <a href="http://www.cancer-network.org/cancer_information/lesbians_and_cancer/lesbians_and_breast_cancer.php">National LGBT Cancer Network </a> which questions the research that has been done to date to draw a lot of conclusions citing that the numbers of lesbians and bisexual women studied have been too small. This website uses the phrase "cluster of risk factor theory" stating the four most-cited cancer risk factors in the research on lesbians and breast cancer risk are:

    <blockquote>

    <ul>

    	<li>   <strong>Cigarette smoking</strong> - data suggest that lesbians smoke cigarettes at a substantially higher rate than heterosexual women.</li>

    	<li>   <strong>Alcohol use</strong> - some research reports higher rates of heavy drinking among lesbians than heterosexual women</li>

    	<li><strong>   Obesity</strong> - some studies report that lesbians are more likely to be overweight or have a Body Mass Index (BMI) over 25.</li>

    	<li>   <strong>Pregnancy</strong> - lesbians are less likely to have biological children before age 30, which would offer some protection against cancer.</li>

    </ul>

    </blockquote>

    Liz Margolies, a licensed social worker, wrote this article where it first appeared on <a href="http://dslrf.org/actwithlove/">Dr. Susan Love's website</a>. Dr. Love as you may recall has written The Breast Book, a comprehensive and highly readable  book on every aspect of breast cancer. She is completing her 6th edition and should be on the market in the near future.]]></p>

    <h2>Friday Afternoon in Corning</h2>
    <h3>June 8th, 2015</h3>

    <p>It's Monday morning and everyone is back to work but me...though I did have a great weekend. As I wrote last week, one of my silver girls came and lectured at Medical Grand Rounds at the health system here. Though I have known her for years, I am never ceased to be amazed at the depth of her knowledge. We celebrated her visit and the completion of her lecture by driving to Corning and popping a bottle of champagne at 2:00 Friday afternoon! (This is the other side of not working for me. I can sip bubbly in the middle of a work day if I choose!) Check out our pitiful baby boomer selfie taken after one SIP of champagne, not one glass:

    <p style="text-align: center;"> <a href="http://www.sherrifillipo.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/champagne-two.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-2577" src="http://www.sherrifillipo.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/champagne-two-300x225.jpg" alt="Baby Boomers &amp; Selfies" width="300" height="225" /></a></p>

    <p style="text-align: left;">I don't know why we didn't stand in front of the flowers or the hills but hey, like I said, we are baby boomers. We talked all afternoon. And then we decided to text her mother as she loves to keep up with our antics. She is lovely and French and will write me the best emails, providing me her opinions on my blogs, her reflections on what I have written. I love to get an email from her mom. So, we sent her this selfie and a couple of other pictures and later on we heard a dainty 'ping' and got the nicest response back - in French of course! In part it said something like, "The balcony is magnificent, a perfect place for <em>farniente.  </em>It is a French word for "sweet doing nothings/delicious idleness." Don't you just love the picture that it conjures up? I think that is exactly what we did all afternoon.  No where to go. No place to be - just the two of us (missing our other silver girl) sipping and talking in delicious idleness...</p>

    <h2>Go Fly a Kite</h2>
    <h3>June 11th, 2015</h3>

    <p>My mom, aunt, and cousin are up from North Carolina and we are having a grand time shopping and eating our way up and down Market Street. Yesterday we sat at the town square and watched local kindergartners race through the town looking for things that started with each letter of the alphabet. The town was a buzz with five year olds and their parents/grandparents trying to keep up with them. The children carried clipboards as large as they were and squealed every time they found a store sign that started with the letter they were working on (hint for next year's students: the word on the street is that in the public restroom there is a hand dryer with the company name "xcelerator" for that pesky "x" that everyone was looking for!)

    After lunch on the square we went over the walking bridge and spent the afternoon in the Corning Museum of Glass gift shop - yes it is that big. You can find everything from five dollar trinkets to $40,000 pieces of glass. Word to the wise: when you shop, keep you elbows in!

    Afterward we walked back over the bridge and noticed an elderly couple flying a kite. We were so taken aback and so misty-eyed at the sweetness of it all. We then began to lament to each other all the ways that that lovely scenario might not happen - one of us said she wouldn't be with anyone at that age, I squeaked out I would never be a grandmother and so on until we came upon them  - the lovely couple turned out to be a young man flying the kite and an elderly gentleman  pushing his walker. They were strangers.  Neither knew the other and we laughed out loud at what our minds had told us we were missing - which it turned out was nothing after all. We had more family together watching that twosome than  anything we were hoping for in that pretend future that we had conjured up! God is funny - reminding us what we have now is often just the right amount.]]></p>

    <h2>Please Keep Sharing Information About Metastatic Breast Cancer!</h2>
    <h3>June 12th, 2015</h3>

    <p>I received an email today from my sister-in-law. She reads the blog faithfully and noticed the comments from a couple of days ago that indicated there weren't a lot of people (world wide, not necessarily  my blog) viewing the <a href="http://www.sherrifillipo.com/?p=2590">Holley Kitchen video about metastatic breast cancer.</a> My sister-in-law is Belgian and was reading an online newspaper in Flemmish when she happened upon the video. She sent me a screen shot pictured below and wanted me to express to everyone reading that information is getting out there and this for me was great proof! Note the right-hand column under "video."</p>

    <h2>Momma Monday is Back!</h2>
    <h3>June 15th, 2015</h3>

    <p>My small world has calmed back down since my mom/aunt/cousin drove away on Friday morning. I think they all left with a greater understanding of the Finger Lakes region than ever before. It is funny if you live in a certain part of the country, other areas seem a bit sketchy. Several times during their visit, we pulled out google maps (once at the museum where there is a large billboard size map and had a little geography lesson.) Beloved says he cannot believe that until I moved here I had never heard of the Finger Lakes. They couldn't figure out where Niagra Falls was compared to where we were and they wanted to relocate New York City to Albany but after we looked at the large map, it all fell into place. I did not ask them to name the lakes in order as even after living here three years, I cannot do it.

    On Thursday, we drove up to Seneca Lake and had lunch. Of course I took them to the <a href="http://fingerlakesdistilling.com/">Finger Lakes Distillery</a>. Though the area is known for its Riesling wines, there is a distillery on the east side of the lake that is making award winning gins, whiskeys, vodkas and my mother's favorite - grappa. Not really.  These family members are not drinkers (minus Mom!) but since the distillery has such a magnificent view of the lake, it is worth a quick jaunt to stand in their parking lot and take it all in. So we did. But I had an ulterior motive. I wanted Momma to take a sip of grappa.

    For those of you who don't know about this mysterious drink, let me put it this way - it tastes like lighter fluid! But there are those out there who love it and you know who you are. Grappa is what is left after the wine is made. It consists of the skins, pulp, seeds and stems of the grapes (yum?). Since I haven't had a Momma Monday in quite a while, this is as close as I was going to get. We all walked in and I noticed that the employees kept vigil on us, waiting for us to walk over and do a tasting. After a while, I went over to a gentleman and told him these ladies were not drinkers and certainly not at 2:00 in the afternoon. But I did inquire whether he would like to see my mother taste grappa.  He grinned and told me to bring her over.

    "Mom. You have to come over her and experience grappa." You know by now she is a good sport but she was hesitant. She told the distiller that she had heard from me that it tasted like kerosene (?) but we both urged her to taste it. So, she did. Then she squealed, "Oh my word. My mascara is melting!" And she swung her head back and forth trying to get it out of her memory! Then she yelled, "My tongue has gone numb!"

    She was not impressed but I told her what a story she could tell when she called Dad later that night. And she did. I think he was impressed.</p>

    <h2>The Unseen World</h2>
    <h3>June 16th, 2015</h3>

    <p>I was out and about doing errands in Corning today and ran into one of my friends. We began to talk about my cancer and a relative of hers that was having some issues with pain. She is a believer of "if you live right, nothing bad should happen to you." I told her that we live in a  <em>fallen world</em> and that until the Lord comes back, there would be lots of bad things happening - even to "good" people. When I tried to explain <em>fallen world</em>, she reminded me that she did not believe in the Bible. And nothing seemed fair. I told her life wasn't fair. Then we moved on to other less difficult topics.

    Later this afternoon, I read my devotional. (You know the one, Sarah Young, <em>Jesus Calling</em>):

    <blockquote>You need a buffer zone of silence around you in order to focus on things that are not seen...the curse of this age is overstimulation of the senses, which blocks out awareness of the unseen world.</blockquote>

    I love to sit and think about an unseen world. That what we see is NOT all there is. Just like the microscopic world around us - we can't see it but no one disputes its existence - there is another world where we as believers will go and then live there FOREVER. And right now, you can't see that one either.  This is want I wanted to tell my friend. That all those things in her mind that are not fair - that bad things happen to "good" people and so on. All of that will be sorted out and will be made "fair" just not by me. By God. I won't have that burden. I will be too busy catching up with my grandmother, my uncle, my great aunt and so on. But I need to get back to her (this was not our first conversation) to tell her that a decision has to be made on this side of the unseen world. It will be too late when she arrives on the other.

    <p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #008080;"><em>So we fix our eyes not on what is seen, but on what is unseen. For what is seen is temporary, but what is unseen is eternal. 2 Corinthians 4:18</em></span></p></p>

    <h2>An Update From My Oncologist</h2>
    <h3>June 17th, 2015</h3>

    <p>I guess when I wrote here of<a href="http://www.sherrifillipo.com/?p=2288"> the last visit with my oncologist</a>, I didn't realize that she and I would still see each other every few months. As a nurse I wasn't thinking  that my port would need to be flushed occasionally even if it was not being accessed. I am fine with that as I love this woman, as you know. So, today we met after not having seen each other since March. It did not take long before our eyes were shimmering with tears.  She asked me how the beach was going and I was so sad to tell her it was not going as I had planned nor had hoped. And so I am telling you, my reader as well. In May, I found the stairs inside my beach house (three levels) and the steps at the beach (multiple flights up, then a landing and then multiple flights down to the water) so daunting and so difficult that as I told her, I began to cry.



    Beloved interjected that my apartment here in Corning is all on one level and though on the third level of a building, I have an elevator that takes me to the top. So while I may scurry around my New York home and feel really confident about myself and my abilities, I arrive in North Carolina and suddenly I am winded and hot and can't do anything....so my time at the OBX is being shortened. I simply have to accept that I cannot do it.

    <p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.sherrifillipo.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/calm-blue-ocean-14485.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-560" src="http://www.sherrifillipo.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/calm-blue-ocean-14485-1024x640.jpg" alt="calm-blue-ocean-14485.jpg" width="600" height="375" /></a></p>

    So then I told my oncologist how frustrated I am that my labs (except the tumor marker) indicate that all is normal and that infuriates me as it is NOT normal on the inside. She smiled and said I was the classic metastatic cancer patient, saying that blood work doesn't reflect what the woman is actually feeling. She said that is why she does not order blood work if the person is not having chemo. It just isn't that helpful. When I asked her about the tumor marker that had doubled since I saw her in March - was that an indicator that it would double again in September, she told me no. She said she bases her assessment now on what the patient describes to her. My eyes widened, "You take <em>subjective</em> information over <em>objective</em> data?" Yes, she said she did. It is much more accurate than any lab work at this time.



    Our time had come to an end. As much as we talk, I wonder if she double books me though I try to be cognizant of her time, I do try to get in as much as I possibly can. I asked her the hated question of all oncologists. The absolute worst question to ask. (I didn't care.) "Time wise. Based on my subjective data (!) and my tumor marker along with my history, how long do you think I have?"

    She looked down and then looked up and said, "I think you are probably correct in saying that you are entering your last year."  I knew it. I love her. She has nothing else to offer but increased palliative care and then hospice and then nothing. I wish every breast cancer patient could have her for their physician. Her last words were, "You are in my thoughts and in my prayers daily."</p>

        <h2>Tattooing Ink Can Cause PET Scan Misdiagnoses: Did You Know?</h2>
        <h3>June 8th, 2015</h3>

        <p>This article is from CBS news. I have never heard of this phenomenon and wanted to share it with you.</span></h3>

        <a href="http://www.sherrifillipo.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/tattoo.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2660 aligncenter" src="http://www.sherrifillipo.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/tattoo.jpg" alt="Girl tattoo artist works on the client" width="424" height="283" /></a>

        <strong>ORANGE, Calif. -</strong><strong>-</strong> A woman with cancer had a major scare after ink from her tattoos caused an imaging test to light up, leading her doctor to believe the disease had spread.

        Dr. Ramez Eskander, an Orange County surgeon, told CBS Los Angeles that ink from his patient's tattoos, which covered her legs and thighs, had lit up her lymph nodes on a body-image test called a PET scan.

        The images led doctors to believe her cervical cancer had spread to her lymph nodes.

        But once in the operating room, doctors learned it was tattoo ink causing the bright spots on her scan -- not cancer cells.

        "When you tattoo, some of that ink will be absorbed in the cells in the lymphatic system and migrate to levels of lymph nodes," he said.

        Eskander published his findings this week in the <em>Journal of Obstetrics &amp; Gynecology</em>. He says the patient's case should serve as a warning to people with body art and their doctors.

        "What we wanted to do is educate physicians, patients, families," he said. "When there is a PET scan that shows a bright lymph node, if a patient has significant tattoos or body art, then you have to be cognizant that these might be false positives."

        In this woman's case, she still received a hysterectomy because she did have cervical cancer. However, because it had not spread as originally thought, she did not need to undergo radiation, which can have lifelong side effects.

        "She was thrilled to share her story with everyone, but she never indicated she regretted the tattoos," Eskander said.

        Eskander hopes his study creates a conversation about early detection and prevention, and says the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine and exams are the key to that for cervical cancer.

        Researchers were not able to determine exactly how much tattoo ink is needed to cause a misdiagnosis from a scan.</p>

    <h2>Treasures Ahead</h2>
    <H3>June 22nd, 2015</h3>

      <p>I am reading a book on everyday celebrations, <i>Cold Tangerines </i>by Shauna Niequist. She writes and thinks in many ways like I do. Sometimes I read a sentence and wish I had thought of it. I sat out on the beach yesterday (yes, I made my way down there with Beloved. I think it was 202 degrees but I am not sure.)

      As I sat and watched fathers and grandfathers play with their families, I read a section about her husband's grandfather. He had recently died while she was pregnant and she lamented how sad she was that her unborn son wouldn't get to meet him, his first great-grandchild. She told of a story about him that I thought was magical.  He and his wife lived on a river and when the grandchildren would come, they would take walks around the riverbank where Grandad would encourage the kids to look really closely in the water for "shiny things."

      And inevitably, the grand kids would find pennies, nickels, quarters. For years, the children thought the river was magical. And then every so often, there would be a new ball bobbing in the water or some other toy.  At the granddad's funeral, the now adult grandchildren sat and talked of all the many ways their granddad had enriched their lives. And then when they got to the story about how Granddad had salted their paths with money and toys, a couple of them did not know until then that Granddad was always walking ahead of them sprinkling treasures in their upcoming paths. Sounds like another Father I know....</p>

    <h2>A Perfect Plan</h2>
    <h3>June 23rd, 2015</h3>

    <p>Remember a few months back I wrote about my <a href="http://www.sherrifillipo.com/?p=2051">three relatives who had been diagnosed with cancer </a>in what felt like rapid succession. As frequent readers know, one of them, my uncle, died quickly from the ravages of cancer within five weeks of diagnosis. I learned on Father's Day,  a second relative awaiting a stem cell transplant has had to postpone the procedure due to other non-cancer related complications. And now my third relative is on his way to NC for consultation among other things. I haven't seen this relative in five years. The last time was at his home where his family welcomed us for dinner and we had a mini family reunion. I had been diagnosed a couple of months prior and at the time was patiently/anxiously waiting on my double mastectomy.

    While on the beach Sunday, I was praying a little bit and knew they were coming to NC and would be closer than I had been to this part of our family since that dinner a lifetime ago. I also had plans this week to drive to my hometown and help my son set up his first apartment and talk life with him as he asked me to do (forever my little  - now big - philosopher.) Of course he is my priority. I haven't seen him since that overhelmeingly <a href="http://www.sherrifillipo.com/?p=1437">tearful goodbye </a>at the NY airport in January. How, I asked the Lord, was I going to be able to see my relative which, as far away as we live, will undoubltly be our last earthly visit together due either to his health, my health or a combination. Let's just say if I were doing all I needed/wanted to do, I would be zig zagging back and forth across the state and you know how little energy this old caboose has especially when the temperature for the week here in NC is supposed to be record - somewhere between 300 and 400 degrees, I think.

    And before I continue telling this tale to  you, I need to say that I never expected my blog to become a devotional - heck I didn't know when I started what it was supposed to be. I wasn't sure what a blog WAS for pity sake. But unlike the author I wrote about yesterday who says that writing for her, and I am paraphrasing, is difficult and time consuming as she can find all kinds of things to do instead of the task at hand. She says if you are the type of writer who sits down and out it flows from your fingertips, we (meaning her and the writer/reader) will never be having coffee together at 9:00am somewhere cool. Meaning, the two people would be so polar opposite as not to have anything in common. She was being a bit tongue-in-cheek but she was in a way describing me. Many times I do have a topic due to a situation but many times I sit down and I am not sure what is going to come out of my finger tips. I do find it interesting that the blog is somewhat balanced - education, devotion, humor but I don't know when and how these three categories will pop up. So that is my disclaimer for today's blog.

    Come to find out my son was just put on 12 hour shifts at his new (!) job and he, as <a href="ttp://www.sherrifillipo.com/?p=2228">a paramedic</a> (just passed the certification!) will be working back-to-back shifts and then will be off several days. Not until I began driving west from the OBX did either of us know that. My out of town relatives will be here this afternoon and instead of being on the highway racing from son to sick relative, I am staying put at Momma Jane's until she and I drive over to dinner about a half hour away this evening while my son sleeps since he is on night shift. And then later this week, I will go and help him start his new adult life, both of us rested.

    Ah, the plans of man. Do you know the verse? <span style="color: #008080;">In their hearts humans plan their course, but the Lord establishes their steps. Proverbs 16:9</span>

    On the beach Sunday, I had decided I needed to be at two places at once. I fretted on the beach for a while about how I was going to do that. How my energy was going to hold up. How I was going to make it through 5:00pm traffic in Raleigh on Tuesday and on and on. And like a knotted ball of yarn, God just unknotted it and wound it into a nice ball ready for use. I cannot wait to see my cousins and my son.</p>

    <h2>Now Where Was I?</h2>
    <h3>June 29th, 2015</h3>

    <p>Holy cow has time  flown by. Last week I did get to see my cousin (and his family) who was in for a medical consultation. He and I laughed while at dinner  his brother and Momma Jane couldn't remember someone's name. And they did this little, "You know...he was tall....you went to school with him...didn't you go to school with him...what was his name?" My cousin looked at me and I at him and I said, "Welcome to our world, right?!"

    It is so true that the older you get, the more family means to you. I didn't want that night to end. They live so far away and we had the best time. We sat at a lovely round table where we could see each other so easily.  Seven of us talking about past reunions, how funny their dad was, how sad and difficult it is that their dear mother is suffering from dementia and so on. But we laughed at old memories and before you know it, dinner was over. Dessert was shared and we kissed and wished my cousin well with his doctor visit the next day...dinner and time with them over in the blink of an eye...

    The next morning I drove into Greensboro to help my son apply for his first apartment. What a day. But as I sat there and watched him complete the application and then go to the bank and obtain his first credit card (no worries - this boy is frugal) I was so thankful in my heart that after such a climb (think Sisyphus and the rock that he keeps pushing up hill just to have it roll back down to start over again...unlike Sisyphus, Jim reached the top and the rock stayed put!) I sat there all day Wednesday as we worked through this process and was so proud of him, my heart hurt.

    <a href="http://www.sherrifillipo.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/IMG_1088.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-2702" src="http://www.sherrifillipo.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/IMG_1088-225x300.jpg" alt="IMG_1088" width="225" height="300" /></a>

    He chose a one bedroom apartment which unbeknownst to us has a small wood burning fireplace. If you know me, you know of all the things in this world, this is just about the most important home feature. And when we looked over and saw it, he just grinned and said, "Oh, cool!"

    More tomorrow. Suffice it to say, I started nesting on his behalf while he worked a 24 hour shift. He told me he trusted my taste and design and to just go for it. It turned out so well for a first bachelor pad, if I do say so myself.</p>

    <h2>Your Teeth and Chemo</h2>
    <h3>June 30th, 2015</h3>

    <p>Well, when it comes to breast cancer, I thought I knew it all but there is one thing that I learned recently that I wanted to share. And that is with chemo comes the potential for tooth loss. I know, between the cancer and the chemo, is anything left alone? Apparently not. I have never had great strong teeth. Between all the candy I have consumed over the years and the lack of fluoridation in our well water growing up, my teeth have always been silvered from one end of my mouth to the other.  Over the past two years,  I have lost two perfectly good teeth. When I mentioned it to my oncologist, she said it was due, alas, to the chemo.

    I knew it could give you a dry mouth and that some chemos can cause mouth ulcers to form but I didn't appreciate that a tooth could just start to wiggle. And the next thing you know, your dentist is getting leverage by putting his foot on your stomach so he can grip the tooth puller better and and yanking that perfectly good tooth out. Then asking you if you want it for a souvenir.

    I also didn't know that I was supposed to contact my oncologist before any dental appointment. Maybe you did. Maybe she told me and I was not listening...but I am supposed to have blood work completed prior to any work  being done to ensure the dentist with the big feet and big hands that I go to doesn't get a surprise when I don't stop bleeding for him. If it's not one thing, it's another.</p>
