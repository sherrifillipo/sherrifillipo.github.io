  <h2>Words of Wisdom From My Hairstylist</h2>
  <p>My hairstylist, whom I love and adore, has been with me on this cancer journey for two years. We had just gotten my once bald head to sport a blunt bobbed haircut - almost - when cancer struck again. We both cried when we looked in the mirror because we had come so, so close to getting me to look like my pre-cancer self. And then it was gone.

  It was Thanksgiving two years ago after the diagnosis that the cancer had spread,  when I told him to cut it all off. I could see the panic in his eyes, all our hard work literally down the drain. He asked me if I wouldn't consider waiting until after Thanksgiving so as not to shock the family, as it were. But I pushed him and indeed he cut my hair. He is young and dear and I wouldn't trade him for anyone else. And I know him pretty well at this point. He left for a few minutes talked to his mentor composed himself and came back, feeling more positive about the haircut.

  We both got a little teary as he went to work but at the end, he said, "You know what, Miss Sherri?" (Yes, that is what he calls me. I don't think I would let anyone else call me that.) We are just going to 'rock this new haircut' like we wanted it to be this way. NOT because we had to! I love his attitude. So we did.

  Later after Thanksgiving, we brought the clippers out and he shaved my head for chemo. He cried. I cried. We are both so tired of all of this.

  So, almost two years later, I went in yesterday for a color and cut. We have decided to keep it short. I mean really short. I think we are doing it for a couple of reasons. One, to ward away the evil spirits (just kidding) but also when the inevitable scan comes back with bad news, I am already sporting the short cut. That much less to shave in the end.

  I also told him today that I was starting a blog and his beautiful blue eyes widened in surprise!  I told him I know I am an old dog but he waved that off. What he told me was that I had to promise not to sugarcoat anything. That my readers needed to understand that this is in real time with potential real emotions coming out of this keyboard. He suggested I place a disclaimer at the top of the home page! I won't go that far but he made me stop and realize, this may not get pretty and making it pretty would do a disservice to those women who might read this and are struggling with breast cancer. He said you don't want to make it look easy because it's not. He is such a wise man to be so very young.</p>
