  <h2>Why Am I Doing This?</h2>

  <p>Today marks my first post. I didn't fully realize what an old dog I was until I started trying to learn about blogs. And now I have a whole new vocabulary with words like slugs, pings and pikes. Oh my. But what I really wanted to do was chronicle what's left of my life for those who care to come along with me. It's difficult having a career come to a grinding halt and then add a terminal disease on top of it. I have always been a writer at heart but now that I am coming upon my second anniversary of metastatic breast cancer, I feel if I am ever going to write, now is the time.</p>

  <h2>Breast Cancer and Seaglass</h2>

  <p>If you were to look through my recent employment history, you would see what appears to be some hiccups. Well, actually the hiccups turn out to be bilateral breast cancer which ground my full-time career to a screeching halt. And if you were to take a second look, just when I got back up and started down that patient safety career highway again, I stopped. Well, although I stopped, the breast cancer decided to take a journey and move on to my liver. So much for dusting myself off and moving on with life.

  So, I now have a lot of time on my hands which allows me to do a lot of thinking...

  I just got back from my vacation on the outer banks of North Carolina where I sat and walked and looked for sea glass, my favorite hobby. As most anyone who has a serious illness will tell you, you spend a lot of time thinking and reflecting on life and death. And it dawned on me while walking last week, that cancer has made me a much kinder, gentler woman. It, like the ocean does to discarded glass, has made me softer, has buffed away my rougher edges. Many relationships have been mended since my diagnosis; many others have gone deeper due to time suddenly not being on my side. My family calls more often. I call more often. Though it has changed my life and those lives around me forever, it has made me thankful for the tumbling and tossing it has done to me - like the glass that fills my jars and my pockets.

  This is again why I wanted to start a blog and have you, if you are interested, follow me as your time and interest allow. In my mind it's a lot like when a group starts out on a walk down the beach together. Little by little, smaller groups form, some walk alone, some catch up to you and walk a while before stopping to pick up a shell or race ahead to someone else. I will be here walking along (at a pretty slow pace!) but join me as you want, when you can. </p>

  <h2>Words of Wisdom From My Hairstylist</h2>
  <!-- Currently having a problem with indentation starting with the 2nd paragraph -->
  <p>My hairstylist, whom I love and adore, has been with me on this cancer journey for two years. We had just gotten my once bald head to sport a blunt bobbed haircut - almost - when cancer struck again. We both cried when we looked in the mirror because we had come so, so close to getting me to look like my pre-cancer self. And then it was gone.

  It was Thanksgiving two years ago after the diagnosis that the cancer had spread,  when I told him to cut it all off. I could see the panic in his eyes, all our hard work literally down the drain. He asked me if I wouldn't consider waiting until after Thanksgiving so as not to shock the family, as it were. But I pushed him and indeed he cut my hair. He is young and dear and I wouldn't trade him for anyone else. And I know him pretty well at this point. He left for a few minutes talked to his mentor composed himself and came back, feeling more positive about the haircut.

  We both got a little teary as he went to work but at the end, he said, "You know what, Miss Sherri?" (Yes, that is what he calls me. I don't think I would let anyone else call me that.) We are just going to 'rock this new haircut' like we wanted it to be this way. NOT because we had to! I love his attitude. So we did.

  Later after Thanksgiving, we brought the clippers out and he shaved my head for chemo. He cried. I cried. We are both so tired of all of this.

  So, almost two years later, I went in yesterday for a color and cut. We have decided to keep it short. I mean really short. I think we are doing it for a couple of reasons. One, to ward away the evil spirits (just kidding) but also when the inevitable scan comes back with bad news, I am already sporting the short cut. That much less to shave in the end.

  I also told him today that I was starting a blog and his beautiful blue eyes widened in surprise!  I told him I know I am an old dog but he waved that off. What he told me was that I had to promise not to sugarcoat anything. That my readers needed to understand that this is in real time with potential real emotions coming out of this keyboard. He suggested I place a disclaimer at the top of the home page! I won't go that far but he made me stop and realize, this may not get pretty and making it pretty would do a disservice to those women who might read this and are struggling with breast cancer. He said you don't want to make it look easy because it's not. He is such a wise man to be so very young.</p>

  <h2>Bucket Lists: Mine and Yours</h2>

  <p>I think a lot about my bucket list.  It probably started after watching the movie <em>The Bucket List </em>starring Morgan Freeman and Jack Nicholson several years ago. At that time, I used the phrase loosely and kept those things in my head that I 'might want to do someday.'  Then when this whole cancer thing came crashing down, I got serious about it and started writing things down. I have a very generous husband who does not want to be mentioned in my blogs so don't mention it, but he has been wonderful in helping me check off some really big items and some very small ones.



  I would urge you to go ahead and make your own list. It would be a good exercise in helping you form what is really important for you to see, do, or accomplish and it also will help you prioritize where to place your time, energy, and money.



  <strong>So far, I have checked off the following items:</strong>

  <ul>

  	<li>Visiting Montreal and practicing my perfectly horrible French on some unsuspecting cab driver</li>

  	<li>Attend one more Eagles concert (although I keep trying to drag this one back on the list, my beloved vetoes it every time!)</li>

  	<li>Eat at the Anchor Bar in Buffalo, NY where they "invented" buffalo wings. Yes, they were delicious. My husband, stepdaughter and her boyfriend came along and we devoured 50!</li>

  	<li>Go to the Caribbean and just sit and look at the blue water. I have never seen such beautiful shades of blue, blue-green. And to our delight we found some seaglass there as well!</li>

  	<li>Go to the Sea Glass beach in northern California. It was amazing! You just walked on seaglass instead of sand. My mother who is seaglass challenged having never been able to find any on her own, asked me to bring her back a bucket of glass (she literally meant a bucket) and I was able to. She just had to sift through the sand and pebbles to find it.</li>

  </ul>

  <strong>What's next?</strong>

  <ul>

  	<li>Living here in upstate New York, I keep hearing about skating on ponds in the winter. Doesn't that sound so Currier and Ives romantic? I know someone special who lives on a BIG pond and she is ready to host me!</li>

  	<li>I want to go down the luge at Lake Placid. My biggest supporter of this trip is my brother-in-law. With his persuasive personality, I keep thinking we will be able to make this a family trip, nieces, nephews and all!</li>

  	<li>I want to see Frank Lloyd Wright's <em>Falling Water</em> home. This will be an easy one as it is just a few hours from my own home.</li>

  	<li>I am a real foodie at heart and want to go to the Culinary Institute of New York and have dinner there. Maybe stay overnight and eat several meals there!</li>

  	<li>And though rather clichéd, I would love to swim with a dolphin. I have loved dolphins since before it was cool, in high school I collected them in glass, wood, and porcelain.</li>

  </ul>

  I really went in depth to get you to start thinking about what you might like to start doing. My urging to you is to start today as we all know, our future is not guaranteed.</p>

  <h2>Bucket List Part 2: The Outrageous and the Letting Go</h2>

  <p>So, since yesterday's post, I have talked to family and friends and they want to know some of the things that I have let go of and  some of my outrageous bucket list items that if I could wave that magical wand, I would make happen. OK, so here goes. (What I am afraid of by doing this is that this list might show more of my strange internal wiring than is necessary!)



  <strong>Things that I have let go of:</strong>

  <ul>

  	<li>I am never going to learn French to the level that I once dreamed of (even with two great friends who are native speakers!)</li>

  	<li>The month of the metastatic diagnosis, I had just completed an application to Loyola for a master's degree in health law; I am so disappointed about letting that go that I still allow them to email me and query my continued interest. But clearly this degree won't happen.</li>

  	<li>Lynne, this is for you: although I pushed through six months of full-time black belt training and completed my project, I moved on from that role and never obtained certification; while I have been given another chance, it seems too daunting to finish that final lap.</li>

  	<li>I will never write a book. I have a quirky southern novel in my head but alas, it will have to remain there.</li>

  	<li>Attending culinary school</li>

  	<li>Being a grandmother</li>

  	<li>I can't go on as I will become too maudlin.</li>

  </ul>

  <strong>My outrageous, need a magic wand for these:</strong>

  <ul>

  	<li>I would love the Eagles to sing Hotel California to me (I told you these were wild) Heck, I 'd let them choose the song!</li>

  	<li>I would love to meet Michael Strahan (former Giants football player and co-host to Kelly Ripa) I am told my mother-in-law can never know this as she is a staunch Eagles fan so if you meet her, keep this under wraps. Why I want to meet him, I don't know. He just seems so likeable. I too, am an Eagles fan.</li>

  	<li>I live 10 minutes from where Tommy Hilfiger grew up and I keep thinking I am going to run into him and he is going to want me to model clothing for his middle age clients. Like he designs anything for middle aged people. Have you ever gone in and looked at the size of the shorts he sells? My linen napkins are larger.</li>

  	<li>I'd like to sing and dance with Jimmy Fallon. Yes, I know I can't sing but in my mind, he won't care! I can keep up with him on the dancing part.</li>

  	<li>I think dinner with Steve Martin would be a crazy good time!</li>

  	<li>I would like to sing back-up (they could turn the microphone off) at a concert of some kind. Anything from a 70's band. My useless knowledge of most all 70's songs is quite extensive. If you don't believe me, ask my in-laws.</li>

  	<li>I would like to be a guest bartender somewhere. I have been told I make a mean margarita and a mean G&amp;T; I have also been told I am a "long pour" and no one would let me tend bar.</li>

  </ul>

  OK, enough of this silliness. Maybe as you are at work on this Friday, you can add to your list and/or come to terms with those things that may need to be let go of so you can spend your time accomplishing what can!]]></content:encoded>

  <h2>My Nemesis NED</h2>

  <p>Although I am not crazy about it, Ned goes everywhere I go. Funny, my husband sort of likes him. Ned lulls him into thinking everything is all right even though all three of us know it is not true. That is the way it often is with metastatic breast cancer. After the shock of the announcement that the cancer has found its way out of your breasts, after the second onslaught of chemo, the second time your husband shaves your head and afterward you put on all of those stupid hats again, it almost becomes routine.

  And then a few months later, your oncologist says with a bright, wide smile, “Your scans show no evidence of disease (NED)” and everyone waits for you to jump up and shout for joy. But you know what? You don’t because unless that proverbial bus creams you on the way to the grocery store one morning, you know how this book ends.

  You don’t know how many chapters are left in the book, true – but you do know who dies in the end. So Ned hops in the car with me as I go about my day and when I meet friends for dinner, one of them will invariably say, “You look so great! You really do! You simply don’t look like you have cancer!” I know she means that as a compliment but I cringe inside as Ned looks on smiling. You see, Ned is a deceiver. He knows that I am not ok, that no matter how much make-up I apply I still don’t have eyelashes. That no matter how good I look, my life is being cut short. I may have two years left, maybe. But Ned is silent – there, but always silent.

  On one of my recent treatment days, Ned was there when a nurse told me that thanks to my reconstruction, I now had the breasts of a nineteen year old! I know she meant it as a compliment to offset an otherwise dreadful situation but I wanted to smack her and Ned both. Though my breasts are indeed beautiful, my chest wall, not to mention my right arm is numb. Completely numb. My reconstruction is all for show. When I am in a foul mood, I say my breasts are useless. Ned knows this and doesn’t care.

  Though I can carry on polite conversation in almost any situation, despite my disease and treatment regimen, Ned is right behind me watching. Case in point – I am a nurse but can no longer work full-time. At a hospital function a few months ago, a pharmacist who didn’t know my background asked me what I did with all my time since I didn’t work. Ned grinned. I told her without any drama, well maybe a little for effect, that when I wasn’t volunteering at a local hospital, I was getting treatment for breast cancer. “Well, you look great!” Ah, yes. I do look great.



  To tell you the truth the only way I get through conversations like the above mentioned is the satisfaction in knowing that at some time in the not so distant future, when my cancer returns, Ned dies. And I will be rid of him forever. No more lingering around, sitting on my shoulder, going with me everywhere I go. I guess in a way I do get to have the last word when it comes to Ned. Though the irony of the situation when this occurs is  not lost on me.

  <h2>PET Scan Today</h2>

  <p>Well, I have been rather crabby for the past two days prepping for my PET scan. Why? Well let me list the things for you that I have not been able to eat for a day and a half: potatoes, rice, bread, alcohol, juice, soft drinks, coffee, any sugar. Are you kidding me? Even though my beloved tried to pacify me with a nice juicy steak last night, which did taste really good, but  how good could it be when I had it with green beans and a glass of water!?!




Whine...whine. So, I got up this morning (without coffee) and drove through the lovely hills of upstate New York and checked in with Radiology. When I was taken back 'on the truck' and an IV started, the radioactive isotopes injected, I was told I needed to lie perfectly still for an hour and that I could not read anything, in any form! Wow! And he left.

So I lay there and wondered how long or how short would an hour be for me? And what should I do? Except move. So, I thought I should at least pray for a while. I had tried to have my devotional time before I headed out. I don't know about you but without two cups of black, strong coffee under my belt in the morning, the rapture could occur and I would be like, "Hey, where are we going? What just happened? I'm not awake yet." But I prayed - for many of you, for my son and then before I knew it, I had fallen asleep. Many of you are not surprised.

Then I was taken back and pushed and pulled through that CT doughnut of a machine. Those can be long minutes when you wish with all your might that you could know right then and there if they are seeing something - but you can't and you don't. You just lie there and listen to the worst music ever.

Afterward, he got me up, handed me some gluten free cookies (don't get me started on that) and out the door I went.

I drove back through the hills, clutching the first cup of coffee that I have had in 48 hours like it was gold. Now the hardest part, not the IV stick, not the claustrophobic CT machine but the wait.

So since I am radioactive until nightfall, I thought I would post this blog which is a lot of nothing (!) and wait for dinner filled with carbohydrates!

I will let you know in a few days the results of the scan...</p>

  <h2>Home Away From Home</h2>

  <p>My southern friends often ask me how I am faring "up there in the north." To many of my friends and family, they can't conceive of living above that ole Mason-Dixon line. They are worried that having cancer while living in foreign land must be more than I can bear. Sometimes, I really go for it and say, "Can you believe we live only three hours away from <em>Canada</em>?!" I try to make it sound as dramatic as possible. I am known for that.

  My southern friends and family heard me complain about a certain southern city I lived in when my cancer was first diagnosed, where the mastectomies occurred, where my first round of chemo occurred, where I fell on my icy deck and had the largest cerebral hematoma anyone had ever seen that didn't require a trip to the Operating Room. The same city that in the spring when all of this cancer tragedy had subsided, I walked out on the same deck and fell right through it - literally - bearing a nasty scar on my shin to this day. I remember screaming to my husband, "Get me out of this damn city! I can't stand it any longer!" And sure enough he did. Because he is that way.

  And before I knew it many months later, I jumped in my car and drove to Corning, New York. I didn't look once in the rearview mirror at that southern city I was leaving. Oh, the relief I felt that day, I cannot describe. For my southern folks, the picture above is downtown Corning. This is the little oasis that we found ourselves living in when six months into our new apartment, I was diagnosed with terminal cancer. I thought we had left cancer behind in the south. This was to be our fresh start. Yet, as Yogi Berra said, "It was deja vu all over again."

  But I am here to tell you, the experience  of having cancer this time was a totally different experience. You see, although only a resident of Corning for six months, I already felt like a member of the community. I was working at Corning Hospital (right across the street from where we lived at the time!) and already felt like a part of the hospital team. Because downtown is only about five blocks long, shopkeepers already knew me - I was supported in every way possible.

  I have never lived anywhere so small - my residences have included  Manhattan, Washington, DC, New Haven, CT, smaller but still larger than Corning places like Raleigh and Winston-Salem, NC. But never in a place where people driving by will call out your name and wave! When I walk up and down Market Street (that's the street in the picture) shopkeepers will wave to me from their stores! I know it sounds like the perfect place and it is in my mind. My stepdaughter came to visit last year, born and raised in Philadelphia, she turned to me and said, "This place is idyllic." Yes! That's the word I had been searching for.

  I love it here. My heart is here and I have encouraged all of my friends and family to come and visit. Every one that has driven or flown in to visit say the same thing, "This place is wonderful!" No surprise that Rand McNally gave it the title "Most Fun Small Town in America!"</P>

  <h2>The Results are In</h2>

  <p>The results of the PET scan are in and I have had a couple of conversations today with my oncologist, whom I adore. What I like most about her (besides the fact that she was a nurse and then went back to medical school) is that she is willing to listen to her right brain when she needs to. It was her right brain that told her two years ago that something wasn't right with me when there was nothing to indicate that there was anything wrong except that I continued to complain about fatigue. She talked me into CT scans and the rest, as they say, is history.

Today she told me that the PET scan shows that there are two lesions on my liver but because we don't have an old PET scan to compare it to, we do not know if they are old or new. But this is where her right brain kicks in that I appreciate. She said her gut tells her something is brewing, that the current medication I am on every three weeks isn't stopping these two lesions from being 'active.' So the plan is for me to add hormonal therapy to my regimen. It will hopefully take away the "fuel" aka estrogen that might be feeding these lesions.

And then another PET scan in 8-12 weeks. If the PET shows activity at that point, I along with my beloved who does not want to be talked about in this blog, will have to decide if I will go back on chemo. Until then, I will continue to ramble here in my blog.

Don't worry. I am fine. It is a beautiful day in Corning. I am sitting here doing the very non-southern thing and drinking a G&amp;T after Labor Day. You do know that you do not wear white pants nor drink G&amp;Ts after Labor Day, right?</p>

  <h2>My Homework</h2>

  <p>Everyone has said, "You are handling this much better than I ever would." They don't know that for sure. I believe everyone has a reservoir of strength that is waiting to be tapped for something - climbing a mountain, childbearing, surgery, any number of stressful situations I can think of. But I want to tell you a couple of months ago, I hit a real low. I had come in to the hospital for a meeting and someone in an office yelled out a greeting like they do in Corning, remember? And though I said hello back, I did not go in to the office and chat. Looking back, I am not sure why. And three hours or so later this person was dead. And I began to cry. A colleague to be sure but not someone I was particularly close to. But I cried. And cried.  Long after  my work friends who had known this person for years had stopped crying, I was still crying.

  Then a couple of weeks later, I was at a leadership meeting and a video was shown of our  hospital construction and I began to cry in the dark. What is wrong with me, I kept thinking. Afterward, when the room emptied,  two of my closest friends and confidants came over and I just wept. One of them said, "I think you need to see someone." And so I did.

  Everything is so close here in Corning which is why I love it. From dry cleaning to sushi, just step outside on Market Street and start walking. You will get there in no time. So I walked over to this large lovely home, now a counseling center and waited, wondering what I was going to say. "Isn't everyone with terminal cancer supposed to be teary?" she might think. The answer is no! I looked up and there she was. We walked upstairs to her office. Lovely office sitting up in the trees. She was so poised and quiet. So I told her my story of the sudden death of a co-worker and it dawned on me as things often do in a counseling office I suppose, that I came face-to-face with death that day and it extended to my own death. Duh.

  Her counsel was simple and powerful. This is what she said:

  <ul>

  	<li>Your body is slowing down, preparing itself for death currently through the forgetfulness, the instability in your gait…it will increase and change as you come nearer and nearer.</li>

  	<li>You’ve been pushing it and pushing it and your body is saying, “It is time to focus inward, and to settle yourself.”</li>

  	<li>Your body cannot and should not be trying to keep up with anyone who is healthy. You cannot do it and it is showing you that.</li>

  	<li>It is time to stop taking care of everyone, friends and family, trying to make sure everyone is ready for your death. It is time to focus inward on yourself and prepare for what is coming.</li>

  </ul>

  I walked out into the late afternoon back to the apartment with some kind of burden that had been sitting on me, lifted. No more crying like that. In the end, do you know what she told me? Start a blog.</p>

  <h2>Joan Lunden, Call Me</h2>

  <p>A friend asked me the other day if I would run out of things to write about! Are you kidding me? I will be long gone and will still have ideas sitting in my "draft" box that this website keeps for me. I promised my mother I would not do anything edgy before October breast cancer awareness month (ugh) but standing in line at Wegmans yesterday I knew there would be no holding back once I got home. You see, as I stood there in line, beautiful, bald Joan Lunden stared back at me on the cover of People magazine with the quote, "I will beat this!" It made me so angry I just had to look away. I wanted to speed dial her and set her straight. I imagined she would pick up the phone and I would say, "Joan. Listen, you have it all wrong. <strong>You</strong> don't get to decide if you will beat cancer - <strong>the cancer does</strong>." And then I would go on to educate her on cancer that stays in the breast versus cancer that leaves it and what a disservice it is to women and families who deal with the diagnosis of terminal breast cancer and how they might worry that they had not fought as hard as say, Joan Lunden and that's why they were dying. Oh, I've gone and gotten myself started!

  I will close to say or maybe it is a disclaimer: October is a rough month for women who are living and dying with metastatic breast cancer. I have so much I want to write about but will wait.

  The ribbon you see above is the ribbon for metastatic breast cancer. I think the colors are befitting.</p>

  <h2>A Mist That Vanishes</h2>

  <p>I have been in Manhattan since Saturday having the time of my life. One of my favorite cities, I am fortunate enough to live four hours away so an easy drive (well, until you get about 20 miles from the city and then you can imagine). My first trip to New York was when I was in high school. I fell in love instantly. I thought it was the most magical place on earth.  The hustle, the bustle, the fashion. I still wonder how women trek through the streets of Manhattan in stilettos.

We are here as my better half sits on a national advisory board of physicians, nurses, IT folks and so on who come together twice a year to discus patient safety issues. They have been kind enough to let me tag along for a couple of years. This is the group that I write articles for that pertain to patient engagement (for you in healthcare you will learn a lot  by logging on to <a title="Engaging Patients" href="http://engaingpatients.org/" target="_blank">engagingpatients.org.</a>)

I have to admit though that when the meetings are in session, sometimes I am acutely aware of my career being over as I am on the other side of the door. I also often feel this way when my husband comes home from work or a friend stops by for a drink and I want to know all about the things that are happening in the hospital and as you can imagine that's the last thing they want to talk about!

So, this morning while these folks are in session, I sat down in my window seat overlooking Wall Street and read my devotional. It never ceases to amaze me how on target some of these are. Today's verse out of the book of James is one of my favorites, "You are a mist that appears for a little while and then vanishes." While that might make some readers sad,  it actually gives me comfort. For you see, no matter how much I want to get out there and grab every last minute of New York (or the world for that matter) I am tired today. So, I am not. I am going to rest and wait until this evening to have dinner and then have conversation with those folks who are behind the closed doors. We are all mist. Knowing that I can't do everything, releases the stress from me allowing me to do some things.</p>

  <h2>Melissa Versus Aretha</h2>

  <p>So a friend and a stranger (who is now a friend) read my bucket list blog, the one list that required a wand to make a dream happen and they decided to get me tickets to see Kelly Ripa, but more importantly Michael Strahan. Unbeknownst to me, they worked on it a couple of weeks. (Who knew it would be such an endeavor?) By the time I left for Manhattan last Saturday, they told me they had secured tickets and that I needed to confirm them via email. But by the time I arrived in my hotel and clicked on the "accept" button, the tickets had been given to someone else.
I was SO disappointed and continued to try and log on through the weekend as I was told tickets could open up at any minute. On Sunday, we went to one of my haunts which is a pizza place beside the Ed Sullivan Theater on Broadway which just happens to be where David Letterman tapes his shows. There was a young woman on the sidewalk who asked me if I wanted to get tickets to the show but I was so hungry I told here I'd be back after lunch!
When I went back to tell her that yes, I would like to see a taping, I was then told it was a lottery system. (Here we go again, I thought.) What the heck. I filled out the form and left.  A few hours later, I got a call that I had gotten a ticket and the next day I found myself sitting in the theater. I had googled who was going to be on the  show and was less than enthusiastic about the guests but what I really wanted to see were the behind the scenes action anyway.
I was seated beside a very interesting man who ended up telling me he was a hairstylist from Miami and by the way he said, "Your short haircut looks faaaabulous!" Little did he know, right Dustin? He then turned to me and said, "I heard that the guest was Aretha Franklin!" Well, that definitely wasn't on the list when I googled it.

And I am sure you know by now that she came out in an aqua ball gown with her own band and five back up singers and belted out "Rolling in the Deep" with a little "Aint No Mountain High Enough" thrown in for good measure!
Can I just tell you though I appreciate her contribution to music, I can't say as I was a fan. But the audience was electrified.  If you google " Aretha and David Letteman" you will see dozens of article and posts about that song. At the end, the audience jumped up and gave her a heart felt standing ovation. I was really overcome. I felt so fortunate to have been in that room yesterday.
This morning, I woke up and turned on Kelly and Michael to see who/what I was missing since this was the  morning that I was hopefully going to be there. Please no one take offense if you are a fan but the singer was Melissa Ethridge....hmmmm...I do believe when God closes the door, he can open up a big, wide window.  And through that window, I heard Aretha sing.</p>

  <h2>Joan Lunden Blog as posted on The Metastatic Breast Cancer Network</h2>

  <p>Joan Lunden, Give Me a Call
    I promised my mother I would not do anything edgy before October breast cancer awareness month (ugh), but standing in line at Wegmans yesterday I knew there would be no holding back once I got home.

    You see, as I stood there in line, beautiful, bald Joan Lunden stared back at me on the cover of People magazine with the quote, “I will beat this!” It made me so angry I just had to look away. I wanted to speed dial her and set her straight. I imagined she would pick up the phone and I would say,
    “Joan. Listen, you have it all wrong. You don’t get to decide if you will beat cancer – the cancer does.”
    And then I would go on to educate her on cancer that stays in the breast versus cancer that leaves it and what a disservice it is to women and families who deal with the diagnosis of terminal breast cancer and how they might worry that they had not fought as hard as say, Joan Lunden, and that’s why they were dying. Oh, I’ve gone and gotten myself started!
    October is a rough month for women who are living and dying with metastatic breast cancer. I have so much I want to write about! Stay tuned.</p>

  <h2>There Is An Elephant in the Room This Month and It’s Pink</h2>

  <p>You know what month this is, right? How could you not with all of the bubblegum pink everywhere on everything. For many of us living with metastatic breast cancer, it is our least favorite time of year for a variety of reasons. But though the month of October is dedicated to breast cancer awareness month, October 13 is the one day dedicated to the disease that is actually killing us. Think about this statement:
    “No one dies from breast cancer that remains in the breast. Metastasis occurs when cancer cells travel to a vital organ and that is what threatens life.”
    I remember when I read that statement for the first time. It was like the proverbial light went on. Now I knew why I was always irritated when I saw women in pink tutus walking in those “we are survivors” breast cancer races. As well intentioned as both the women and the races are, many of those women who are so excited to call themselves “survivors” really aren’t survivors! Ouch. I know I step on toes by saying it but the truth of the matter is this, if the cancer doesn’t leave the breast, you don’t die from the disease. You get to die from something else. The statement from above is taken from an organization that I would bet many people have never heard of: The Metastatic Breast Cancer Network http://mbcn.org/  whose slogan is, “fighting for treatments to extend life.” Note that it does not say to survive breast cancer or to beat breast cancer because if you currently have metastatic breast disease the focus is on control of the disease and the quality of life that remains. Remember, we know how this cancer book ends. We know who dies in the end.

    Those of us, around 155,000 living with metastatic disease in the US, aren’t typically the ones in tutus racing through the streets of America. We are too tired, too sick, too tethered by IV tubing to our local hospitals to do much dancing. This is how you can help: To see women who are living and dying with metastatic breast disease as a very different patient population from the women who have experienced ductal carcinoma in situ breast disease (cancer inside the breast). After my double mastectomy, a nurse practitioner once told me, “Don’t ever let a woman who has had a simple lumpectomy tell you that she knows how you feel. Because she doesn’t.”
    Until I was diagnosed with metastatic disease, I did not know that only 2% of the annual cancer fund of $5 billion is slated for Stage IV cancers of which breast metastasis is a subset. It has taken me a while to appreciate the fact that the “pink ribbon breast disease” as I call it is the pretty disease. Metastatic disease is not. It is the ugly disease. We are the group of women who scare the ladies in pink tutus because we are dying from the disease that they are running scared from. We  are the women that are ignored by the pink ribbon organizations because we are living examples that you can do everything right and still die from breast cancer. We are the reminders that you can have your screening mammogram every year, without fail, just like I did, and still have invasive cancer diagnosed after your annual mammogram. We make other women uncomfortable. And I believe that is why so infinitesimal is the money given for metastatic disease research.
    Let me put it another way. Do we really need more money funded for breast cancer awareness campaigns? Who in heaven’s name is not aware of breast cancer? What we need is money funding the disease that is killing 44,000 of us in the US annually. Soon it will be me. Which is why I write and which is why I am asking you to come to grips with the two diseases. And acknowledge that one size does not fit all. You can do all the self-breast exams you want; you can get an annual screening mammogram; you can do everything in your power to thwart the disease but if it is going to get you, it is going to get you. Early diagnosis does not equal survival. Good girls are not the ones who get screened and don’t get breast cancer just as the bad girls are not the ones who get the screenings and still go on to get the disease.
    We need to shift our paradigms and take a stand that money be shifted as well to finding the cures for the disease. It’s too late for me but not for someone close to you. A future child? A future grandchild? October 13 is dedicated to those of us who won’t get out of this alive - National Metastatic Breast Disease Day.</p>

  <h2>The Source Of My Humor and Storytelling?</h2>

  <p>I have been asked over the past few weeks where my humor comes from and how I learned to "story tell" as someone called my writing. Well, it may start with the picture that you see here. I am the younger girl in the photo and my sidekick is my aunt, Marie. All of eight years older than me. Old enough to be dating when I couldn't, young enough to take me to the local 7-11 and spend money on me for candy. And oh did we buy candy. My silver filled teeth can testify to that. I was really like the 5th child in line. My mom had me young and she being the oldest had three younger siblings and then came me. Marie being the fourth child,  I am closer in age to her than she is to my mom,  her sister - hence this relationship.
  Marie is funny. If you don't believe it, ask her to do her "wide-mouth frog" routine. Or her "wishy washy" routine. She was so cool. I would watch her go to football games in the late '60's while I hung back with her mother, my grandmother. I loved to  spend weekend nights with Nannie as I called her.  Though I hated Lawrence Welk, she kept poptarts in the cupboard for Marie and my Uncle Bill and when I was there I could have two if I wanted! Nirvana!
  I would often sleep in Marie's bed when I visited (when I wasn't in my Aunt Susan's bed - I would go back and forth) and if I could keep myself awake til midnight or whenever she came in, she would tell me the story about  Smokey the Bear fighting forest fires. I have NO idea where she got the idea for that one but over and over and over again I would ask her to tell me that story. And she complied every time without complaint.
  So maybe it was trying to emulate her through my formative years that laid the foundation for the humor and the writing. All I know is that she along with Aunt Susan are regular readers of this blog and for that, I am thankful.

  PS: Marie just texted me. Still very cool for a grandmother of four - and she said after she read this post, it reminded her of me coming home with them most Sundays after church. And the first thought I had was, "Oh shoot a monkey!" Which is another phrase she still says (no PETA people, we don't have monkeys in my home state of NC, nor did Marie and I go out hunting them.) Because then I had another memory of fried chicken every week. And because I was the youngest and oh so adorable (!) I got to choose which side of the "pully bone" to choose to make my wish come true. Aunt Marie and Uncle Bill occasionally got irritated that they didn't get to choose, but there are some advantages of being the first grand child. So, we would pull and pull until one of us had won. Oh they were good ole days.</p>

  <h2>Mammography: What I Bet You Didn’t Know</h2>

  <p>There has been a lot of controversy about mammograms in the past few years. Some heralding them as life savers, some wanting them to be done on younger and younger patients and so on. The woman you see here is probably familiar to you. Her name is Amy Robach and she used to be an anchor on NBC's Today Show. Then she moved over to Good Morning America. She recently had her first mammogram and they  found a mass. She is currently seeking treatment. She has stated publicly that the    mammogram saved her life. Hmm... Listen to what the renowned breast surgeon, Dr. Susan Love  http://www.dslrf.org/breastcancer/  author of the definitive book on breast cancer entitled,  Dr. Susan Love's Breast Book said in response:
  “Did the mammogram save her life, as one doctor was quoted as saying? The answer, of course, is we don’t know. While mammography is capable of finding about 26% of cancers at a point where it makes a life-saving difference in the outcome, it also finds many lesions which would never have gone on to be life-threatening and others which will still be life-threatening in spite of early detection and rigorous screening."
  "The problem is not the mammogram as a detection tool, but the natural history of the disease, which brings us to the crucial point…not all breast cancers are the same. Before a treatment is prescribed or chosen, it is critical that a woman or man knows what kind of breast cancer they have of the roughly 5-7 kinds we can now recognize. There are probably many more kinds that we just don’t know about or know how to recognize yet. The behavior of the cancer is dictated not as much by when it is found as by what kind it is and how that kind usually behaves. This information informs the decisions about treatment. …"
  "We all need to help tone down the hype that mammograms are the be-all/end-all life-saving tool and stop fueling mass fear that a questionable mammogram is a potential death sentence.”
  Dr. Loves' book is highly readable whether you have breast cancer or not. What I learned from her interview is that mammography is not as straightforward as the public believes.

  <h2>A Question From My Son</h2>

  <p>I have one child - a handsome 23 year old who is finishing up a degree to begin work as a paramedic. He is equally skilled in the kitchen. I think he will make a wonderful catch for someone but I digress. He lives in NC where he attends school so sadly our communication comes from texts, calls and visits every few months. It was last summer when he came to the beach house and after a swim, dinner and a soak in the hot tub, he walked into my bedroom. I was sitting on the side of the bed; he walked over, put his arms around me and said nothing for a long time. It was so good to be near him. I miss him terribly; for many reasons he and I were extremely close when he was growing up. The two years  I spent  homeschooling him, he recently told me were the two best years of his childhood. Wow.
  That night, he turned to me and asked, "What is it like living between two worlds -  one foot on earth and one foot in heaven?" If you know my son, you are not surprised at the depth of that kind of question. His preschool teacher used to call him her philosopher at the ripe old age of four. Another mentor called him his little theologian.
  I told him I hadn't thought of it that way but indeed that is exactly how I feel. I really don't sweat the small stuff anymore. I am freed by a lot of the things that you, the reader, are not. I no longer try to envision what living in a nursing home would be like. The stock market has no effect on me. I no longer wonder when I can retire. I no longer wonder what I will look like at 70, 80. I tell people I love them freely. I eat ice cream any time I want.
  I am much more focused on my movement toward heaven as time slips by and I am very cognizant of every day, of everything.  I experience things so acutely now. The leaves turning this fall have never been more beautiful. The river that runs through out town never lovelier. Every time my son calls, when he texts me that he loves me, I am overwhelmed with love for him, for others, for God. I am not sure how much time I have and yes I do feel like I am living in two worlds. I am at peace with that.</p>

  <h2>Women of Faith</h2>

  <p>I saw my oncologist today. She and I are  women of  faith. When we are alone, we discuss the human and spiritual dimensions of this disease and where it is taking me, my husband and my extended family. I am so thankful for her. She is young and wise and takes all the time I need when I am struggling. We have both been tearful together; we pray for each other. I am deeply blessed to have her overseeing my care.

  But when I say faith, I know that means different things to different people. I feel I owe it to you my family and friends to explain what I mean. Yes, I grew up in the south where some would say, it's easy for you to claim faith, as everyone 'down there' goes to church. I agree that many do go to church but as a minister once said, "walking into a church doesn't make you a Christian anymore than walking into a garage makes you a car." I heard that as a young person and thought it was funniest thing I had ever heard at the time.

  <strong>These are the things I believe:</strong>

  <ul>

  	<li>I believe there is a  God who orchestrated the heaven and earth. I am not hung up on evolution.</li>

  	<li>I believe the world has fallen into sin from the very beginning. I am not hung up on a real or an extended six-day creation.</li>

  	<li>I believe that for every sin, there must be a payment for that sin (if you hate that word, substitute 'wrongdoing').</li>

  	<li>Until God sent his son, Jesus, to be the ultimate payment for Sin (any and all and everyone's) there was a separation between God and man.</li>

  	<li>Christ came, lived and then died for our sins. Every last one of them. Which is why we no longer bring birds, bulls, calves to the altar.</li>

  	<li>I believe he arose after three days. I really, really do. An actual resurrection.</li>

  	<li>Christ is the bridge between God and man.</li>

  	<li>I believe that as the scripture says, that He has gone to make a place for me (for me!) in heaven. I can't wait to see what my room looks like in that mansion. I'm thinking a fireplace in my bedroom with a Siamese cat sleeping at the foot of my bed, just waiting on me. We'll see!</li>

  	<li>I do believe in an actual heaven and actual hell. No, I do not believe that everyone will go to heaven.</li>

  	<li>No, I do not believe that there are many ways to heaven through many different spiritual paths.</li>

  	<li>Going to heaven is easy. The only thing you have to do is accept that you are a sinner (To me that is easy as I have done SO much wrong in my life) and that you need to be forgiven for your sins. I don't know  about you but I would rather trust/acknowledge that Jesus is my payment rather than the herd of cattle I would have to bring to the altar way back in the day. And then through prayer, ask Him to be your savior.</li>

  	<li>When I pray, I am praying to the author of the universe and I believe that He is listening.</li>

  	<li>Does this confession and acceptance as Christ as savior make your life easier? No.</li>

  	<li>Does this protect you from all harm and disease? Again, a big No.</li>

  	<li>Will believing help you get through all of the disease, disappointment, disillusion of the world? A big yes.</li>

  	<li>Is it ever too late to become a believer? Absolutely not.</li>

  	<li>Are there any sins too horrific to be forgiven for? No.</li>

  </ul>

  I feel better just letting you know where I stand. He is what gets me through the days. He is who I cry out to. He is who gives me spiritual comforting that weaves with the human comforting I get from my husband, my friends and my family. In this day and age of diversity and doing your own thing, I know it all seems square. I  get it - assurance of salvation.</p>

  <h2>The End is Near</h2>

  <p>This past weekend the town of Corning hosted its annual marathon wine glass festival. Above you see the sweet faces of my two stepdaughters. One was running and the other injured, is just coming along side her sister at the finish line. They are great young women who have welcomed me into their family with much grace. I love to have them come and visit. The one on the right is the one from several posts back who  labeled the town of Corning, "idyllic."  And I must add one boyfriend who joins in as well. They are three dynamite people and when I sit and have a glass of wine with them, I feel I am young again. They laugh at the stupid things I say. We talk about everything and they tolerate my belting out '70's hits on the radio when we go exploring up in the finger lakes wine region which we always seem to do.



  They have been so, so patient with me through this blog adventure and especially through the month of October. When something I find obnoxious comes on the television at night, I don't even have to ask their permission to mute the screen. They know I cannot take very much during this month.



  While their dad, my husband who does not want to be mentioned, the boyfriend and I drank mimosas Sunday morning while we waited on Heather (right) to finish. We noticed a woman near the finish line that held out a bright orangish sign that simply read, "The end is near." It caught me as hilariously  funny as a non-runner and knowing that my own end is near (I didn't need a middle-aged woman holding a sign to remind me!) But she stood there for at least 45 minutes to the point that the dear boyfriend, who is a phenomenal photographer I might add, slipped outside to take her photograph holding the sign. Come to find out in the running world, wacky signs toward the finish line are not uncommon. I just found it ironic and hilarious that she chose outside my restaurant window to remind me of something I already know!</p>

  <h2>My Golden Girls</h2>

  <p>
    I am off this weekend to see two childhood chums. Between the three of us, we have <strong>not</strong> had a lot of down time. Between the three of us we have 92 years of marriage logged under our belts six college/advanced degrees, each of us has one child a piece. That to me has always been  interesting to note. One came by surprise, one by adoption and one through perseverance.  We wouldn't trade them. We grew up in the 60's when lunch was 30 cents, where we spent a lot of time outdoors and a lot of time talking about boys.



    One friend I met in the first grade. She was THE popular girl with long wavy black hair. She was the 'girlfriend' of the most handsome six year old I could imagine back then. (We didn't know Donny Osmond at that point.) She took dance lessons of which I coveted and later as a young adult had to ask forgiveness for as I had buried that covertness in my heart for a lot of years. The only dancing I did was when I took the trash out or when Soul Train came on Saturday afternoons. I remember in the second grade while learning mythology (why were we learning mythology when the Viet Nam war was going on? I still don't know). She was chosen as Helen of Troy (I should have known). I was back-up Aphrodite. "Oh" but the teacher said, "She is the goddess of love and beauty!" Like I didn't know that I was still second fiddle. But my friend was never one to taunt her first grade fame. She is and has always been modest.



    The other friend, I met in the fourth grade at the water fountain. She came careening around the corner and stopped. She looked at me and said,  Don't you just hate it when your slip hangs out beneath your dress?" I thought, "Who are you,  and I am not sure I even own a slip!" And she has been my friend ever since and continues to pull at her slip.



    I love them. We survived being bussed across town back and forth every two years. And though our closeness has waxed and waned as all long term friendships do, breast cancer for two of the three of us has cemented our middle years together.  I love them both. We are three very different people but we share a common southern background that no one can take from us. Sadly, we  recently came together for one of our mother's funerals. It was a mix of happy and sad. We hadn't all been in the same room in 15 years? I  am just guessing.



    I am a firm believer in the saying that new friends are like silver, the old ones gold. They are my 'golden girls.'</p>

    <h2>Sabrina Has Left the Building</h2>

    <p>When I return for my next infusion at the Cancer Center,  my nurse of two years will not be there. For two years, she and I have had a date every third week for the better part of a morning (or afternoon). I met her two Thanksgivings ago when it was time to start chemo again. I remember staring out a window, teary-eyed and in disbelief when Sabrina walked into my cubicle. I turned around to meet her and when she saw me weepy, she hugged me right off the bat. Little did I know that Sabrina does not do that very often. I don't think that she realized at that moment that she was staring into the eyes of someone with newly diagnosed metastatic disease and when I reminded her, her eyes conveyed a more knowing and sympathetic look. My second port of which she got the privilege of accessing was far more tender and so swollen as compared to my first one that I didn't think I would make it through that morning but I did. Thanks to her wicked sense of humor and her tenacity.



    In Virginia, I was used to lying down to have chemo and here, there is only one bed and many recliners. Although she didn't fully understand why I was so attached to that one bed, she made sure that if it was within her power, she would have that bed ready for me. A true patient advocate. And seeing someone every third week, one gets to know someone very quickly. And she and I became fast friends both as women but also as nurses.  She said one of the toughest things she has done in her career is break the shell of my better half but like I say, her wit and her zaniness, even he couldn't resist. We became a trio.



    When I went through my rough patch after my colleague died (written about several posts ago) I cried a lot that day during my infusion. It was tough on her I think because I have been pretty upbeat throughout these past two years but that day she was stressed because I was stressed and I continued to think what a great and empathetic nurse she was.



    But as in life, all good things must come to an end. She once told me she didn't look forward to my demise as we have become so close. And then she told me last month that she had accepted an offer in another healthcare organization. I told her based on my last PET scan, she was getting out just in time. Our humor is that way. I will really miss her and am getting all choked up as I write. But I know she reads this blog - she affectionately calls it stalking me. So, Sabrina, thank you for taking such good care of me - for meeting all my needs. Thank you for not holding back the <em>candy</em> when I needed it. I will miss you dearly.</p>

    <h2>Metastatic Breast Cancer Alliance: October 2014 Executive Summary</h2>

    <p>Today's post comes from the  Metastatic Breast Cancer Alliance <a title="Metatstatic Breast Cancer Alliance" href="http://www.mbcalliance.org" target="_blank">www.mbcalliance.org </a>October 2014 Executive Summary entitled, <em>Changing the Landscape for People Living with Metastatic Breast Cancer.  </em>I know some of what you will read, I have mentioned in previous posts but this is so important. Thank you for indulging me during the month of October:



    "A greater understanding of what MBC is and how it differs from early stage breast cancer is needed among patients, their families and healthcare providers, researchers, and the public.

    <ul>

    	<li>The focus on "fighting" and "beating" breast cancer has led to the creation and dominance of a breast cancer "survivor" which masks the reality that women who have had early stage breast cancer can develop metastatic disease.</li>

    	<li>The focus on screening and survivorship can stigmatize patients who experience a recurrence or are diagnosed at stage IV - they may be perceived to be at fault for the cancer's progression.</li>

    	<li>The effects of public and professional misconceptions or lack of understanding about metastatic breast cancer  can negatively influence decisions made by patients and their doctors regarding treatment and quality of life.</li>

    	<li>More can be done to build the understanding of  healthcare providers about how to discuss treatments and quality of life, including palliation of their patients."</li>

    </ul>

    <strong>This quote resonates with me so much:</strong>

Our medical team did nothing wrong. Metastatic breast cancer happens...at any time...regardless of your age, whether you did chemo[therapy], radiation, had a mastectomy, had a bilateral mastectomy, ate well, took vitamins, exercised regularly, prayed, had positive thoughts, had negative thoughts, got regular mammograms, did self- exams religiously, had a tiny stage 1 primary tumor, or a stage 0 primary tumor, or a stage 3 primary tumor, or never even had primary breast cancer. <strong>It doesn’t matter</strong>.” —MBCN website (emphasis mine).

    <h2>Now, Meet My Silver Girls</h2>

    <p>Lest you think from my "golden girls" post that those two are the only ones I care about, you would be wrong. I want to introduce you to my two <em>silver</em> <em>girls</em>. These two I have been friends with for all of five years. I met them both when I lived in Connecticut. I hold them dear to my heart. They are both physicians which impresses the socks right off of me. Women who were able to navigate medical school back when it wasn't shall we say so 'diverse'? I marvel at their intellect. But they are also a boatload of fun.



    The first friend is an epidemiologist and I got to know her when I worked at Yale-New Haven Hospital. She and I co-led the hospital hand hygiene initiative which sounds like a real yawn unless you had sat through our presentation/lecture. By the time we had taught around 300 people, we had our song and dance down pat and the audience loved us, if I do say so myself! If being a physician isn't impressive enough, she is also from French descent and speaks it fluently. She is an avid runner and has a physique that I will never have. And she loves a good strong margarita. Yes, she sounds almost perfect!



    My other friend, also a physician, is the Director of Patient Safety at the hospital association where I also worked. She has a keen mind for details and can coordinate huge programs to accommodate members from all 28 hospitals across the state. She always has a kind word and has a way of navigating through difficult work situations with aplomb. She is elegant and thoughtful. The best part about her? She, too, loves a good margarita!



    I feel like I am the luckiest girl in CT when we three get together. Over the last year, I had been driving back into New Haven to volunteer at Yale about once a month. To be frank, I was not ready to leave Connecticut when we did but that's life. I believe it also symbolizes "health" to me as I was diagnosed almost immediately after moving from CT to Virginia.  So, I go back. I walk the shore across the street from my former home on the Long Island sound. I collect seaglass as I walk. I drive down and  get harassed at the local Italian restaurant by two of the long time bartenders. If you let them harass you long enough, they will pour you a glass of wine on the house, so why wouldn't I just sit there and take it for a few minutes? And then I go out with my two silver girls.



    We have gone to different places but the one that I think we all three lean toward is an upscale Mexican restaurant near the hospital. (If you are ever there, it is Geronimo, their website is: <a title="Geronimo" href="http://geronimobarandgrill.com" target="_blank"><em>geronimobarandgrill.com</em></a> ) They serve the best margaritas and some of the best Mexican food I have ever eaten. We typically get a high top table  near the bar, and order the guacamole made tableside and along with the margaritas and talking to those two, I think I am in heaven. In fact, if heaven were like that, I would be perfectly happy.



    Since I am at Yale just about 48 hours when I go, we can get together once. So we end up talking at rapid fire speed to get in all that we need to get in before I leave. These two are precious to me because although I didn't grow up with them, they cared for me long distance during the dark days of surgery and chemo in Virginia. They sent cards, cookies, emails. One of them decided I needed some spring in my long dark winter here in NY during my second series of chemo and sent me a half dozen jewel-toned scarves to wrap up in. They are too good to me.



    So the three of us are figuring out how to get together. I am having more difficulty making the 10 hour round trip to Connecticut. I think they may be coming to upstate New York  before the holidays. I can hardly wait. Though there are no restaurants to compare to Geronimo here, I am known for being able to make a mean margarita!</p>

    <h2>My Yaya's: Somewhere Between the Golden Girls and the Silver Girls</h2>

    <p>One last group of women that need to be brought forward and recognized are my ya-ya's. Who? Do you remember the 2002 movie starring Sandra Bullock called The <em>Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood</em>? I bet many of you do. Well, at Cone Hospital there were five of us in perioperative leadership that constituted the ya-yas. One was the director of the Operating Room. She had been working in the OR  many years prior to my arrival and she was the one responsible for giving me a weekend option position when I had my son, allowing me to work Saturday and Sunday nights and therefore I was home Monday - Friday to care for Jim.  And for that I will always be grateful. She was fun and happy and when she led a meeting that she  felt was getting out of hand she had a hallmark saying.  She would open up her arms and pull her hands toward her chest and repeat, "Come on people. Come on back to me." It worked every time. I even do that now in meetings and think of her each time!



    The second ya-ya was the Director of the Recovery Room, known as the PACU to us. She is small and feisty like my mother and I often told her she looked like my mom as well. She was the one if there was some disaster brewing in the hospital, all you needed to do was page her and add "911" to the call-back message and she came to the rescue. When we would all drive together somewhere, she was the one screaming for us to slow down when anyone else was driving and if she was driving, she was a big believer in no left turns (she made that concept popular before UPS did!)



    The third director was tall, thin and impeccably dressed in Talbots, head to toe. She had the unfortunate job of being at the hospital at 5:00am or before as she was the director of  the pre-operative department. (Someone had to get everyone ready prior to a 7:30am OR start, right? Well, her team did it.) By the time I arrived to work some days, she had already worked a half day and was ready for lunch! This ya-ya had a quiet disposition but if any surgeon tried to ruffle her feathers, she could take him down in an instant. Some surgeons went months trying to ignore her in the department. She considered that a victory!



    The last ya-ya was my partner. While I was the clinical specialist in the OR, she was the specialist in the pre-operative and post-operative phases of surgery. Together we educated, oriented, taught courses, updated standards, wiped the tears of many an orientee and  we were the support team that backed up the three directors mentioned above. I call her "Country Mouse" and she calls me "City Mouse." Do you remember that children's story? Well, to this day she will email me or text me and start with: "Mouse".......



    Five of us. People told us in the hospital that we ran in a pack - five long, white lab coats flapping in the wind as we would put out one fire here, another fire there.



    At lunch time, one of the ya-ya's always paged the other four and we would meet in someone's office and off we would go to the cafeteria together. I guess we did run in a pack, didn't we? We weathered marriages, divorces, children, grandchildren, illnesses, diseases. As the world in that large five hospital system changed and swirled around us, we were "tighter than ticks" as they say down south.



    I was the one who broke up the group when I left and moved to Connecticut. When I then moved to Virginia, and was diagnosed so quickly, they packed up a car and drove to spend the weekend with me. We had a ball - laughing and reminiscing. One of the ya-ya's bought a pair of stilettos while there (she was always sporting 4" heels) and I bought a mink stole at a vintage shop. That night at dinner I put on the heels and the mink and sat on my back porch with them while we had cocktails. Nothing was too dumb to do around those women. We had been through personal and professional hardships and there were  no fronts to keep up.



    God is funny. The new person who took my position so reminded me of myself 20 years prior, it was amazing. Passionate about the OR, long ponytail swinging when she walked, even staff in the OR told her, "You sure do remind me of Sherri." She says it pleases her. It certainly pleases me.</p>

    <h2>One Out of Eight Will Get Breast Cancer: What I Bet You Didn't Know</h2>

    <p>Again I quote from Dr. Susan Love's website on the explanation of the "one in eight" statistic that is quoted often and everywhere. See if it doesn't make you think differently after reading this:


    <a href="http://www.sherrifillipo.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/breast-cancer.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-923" src="http://www.sherrifillipo.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/breast-cancer-300x300.jpg" alt="Breast Cancer Word Cloud Concept in red caps" width="324" height="324" /></a>



    Dr. Love states:



    "The one-in-eight statistic doesn't accurately reflect the average woman's breast cancer risk. Age is the most important risk factor for breast cancer. That means the older a woman is, the greater her risk of developing the disease. Statistics from the US National Cancer Institute show that a woman's chance of being diagnosed with breast cancer by age is:

    <div id="navcontainer" class="carrot2">

    <ul id="navlist2">

    	<li><span class="expandTextL">From age 30 to age 39:     0.43 percent      (often expressed as  1 in 233)</span></li>

    	<li><span class="expandTextL">From age 40 to age 49:     1.45 percent       (often expressed as  1 in 69) </span></li>

    	<li><span class="expandTextL">From age 50 to age 59:     2.38 percent      (often expressed as  1 in 42)</span></li>

    	<li><span class="expandTextL">From age 60 to age 69:      3.45 percent      (often expressed as  1 in 29)</span></li>

    	<li><span class="expandTextL"><strong>Ever</strong> . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .<strong>1</strong> <strong>in</strong> <strong>8</strong> (emphasis mine)</span></li>

    </ul>

    </div>

    <strong><span class="main"><em>Ever</em>  is lifetime risk. This means a woman has a one-in-eight chance of getting breast cancer after the age of 70 </span></strong><span class="main">(emphasis mine).</span>



    These probabilities are averages for the whole population. An individual woman’s breast cancer risk may be higher or lower, depending on a number of factors, including her family history, reproductive history, race/ethnicity, and other factors that are not yet fully understood. "

  <h2>Boston Globe: Expand conversation to include metastatic breast cancer</h2>

  <p>Anne Morris who is the chief executive officer of Susan G. Komen Massachusetts wrote a powerful article in the <em>Boston Globe</em> today of which I have taken an excerpt. Some days I have hope that metastatic breast disease will get the coverage it needs. Today is one of those days.

  <blockquote><!-- inside story_update.jpt --><!-- end article-text --><!-- Story tools --><!-- position:Bottom --><!-- uuid: aff92c60-5881-11e4-8cbb-6f10485da42a -->According to a recent survey, it’s clear that societal awareness of metastatic breast cancer shows a lack of understanding, and highlights the need to move beyond the current conversation. In fact, <strong>63 percent of Bay Staters surveyed know little or nothing about metastatic breast cancer, while 70 percent think advanced breast cancer is curable. Additionally, 47 percent think cancer progresses because the patient either didn’t get the right treatments or didn’t take the right preventative measures </strong>(emphasis mine).



  Given all this, it’s no wonder those living with metastatic breast cancer can feel excluded from the larger dialogue and emotionally unsupported. This lack of understanding on the part of the general public excludes these women, and their stories, from the daily dialogue.



  Women in Massachusetts and from all across the nation are at risk due to this huge communication gap when it comes to metastatic breast cancer. Helping those living with this dreadful disease feel like part of the conversation is an urgent matter.



  Metastatic breast cancer isn’t curable. In fact, the average survival time following a metastatic breast cancer diagnosis is approximately three years, and even lower among certain ethnicities. It remains the second leading cause of cancer deaths among women today.



  According to a study published in the journal The Oncologist, roughly one in three — nearly 30 percent — of women diagnosed with early breast cancer will eventually be diagnosed with metastatic breast cancer.



  Those of us who know someone diagnosed with breast cancer, even if it’s not advanced, need to heed the call to expand our knowledge of the disease and to understand the profound emotional toll that patients go through. These patients have different needs and different struggles than those diagnosed with early stage breast cancer."</blockquote>]</p>

  <h2>Dr. Susan Love's Take on the "October Pink Tsunami"</h2>

  <p>
  I read Dr. Love's blog<a title="Dr. Love's Blog" href="http://blog.dslrf.org/" target="_blank"> http://blog.dslrf.org/</a> today and thought that her words were powerful.  This is just a portion of  the blog:

  <blockquote> In addition, many companies agree that supporting breast cancer research and awareness is good politics and good business. Sometimes these well-meaning efforts, such as the recent pink drilling bits for the cure, can appear misguided, but that does not mean that the people who donated the money had nefarious motives or that the money will not be well spent.



  As we all compete for the public’s attention and dollars, we sometimes forget that this is not a race with just one winner; it is a team sport. There are many ways we can save the lives of women and men with breast cancer, whether it be by helping them get diagnosed and appropriately treated, or by focusing on research into possible causes, be they environmental, lifestyle, or genetic. There is no lack of areas that need money and serious study. For example, we don’t even know the anatomy of the ducts in the breast or exactly how breast cancer starts!



  <strong>When the NFL is wearing pink, it’s pretty clear that, collectively, we have achieved awareness </strong>(emphasis mine). We need all the organizations with their different perspectives to focus on their missions while joining in a collaborative effort to find the cause and ways to prevent breast cancer. Because the end goal, a future without breast cancer, is one we all can agree on."</blockquote>]</p>
