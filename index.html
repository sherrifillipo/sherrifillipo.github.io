  <h2>Why Am I Doing This?</h2>

  <p>Today marks my first post. I didn't fully realize what an old dog I was until I started trying to learn about blogs. And now I have a whole new vocabulary with words like slugs, pings and pikes. Oh my. But what I really wanted to do was chronicle what's left of my life for those who care to come along with me. It's difficult having a career come to a grinding halt and then add a terminal disease on top of it. I have always been a writer at heart but now that I am coming upon my second anniversary of metastatic breast cancer, I feel if I am ever going to write, now is the time.</p>

  <h2>Breast Cancer and Seaglass</h2>

  <p>If you were to look through my recent employment history, you would see what appears to be some hiccups. Well, actually the hiccups turn out to be bilateral breast cancer which ground my full-time career to a screeching halt. And if you were to take a second look, just when I got back up and started down that patient safety career highway again, I stopped. Well, although I stopped, the breast cancer decided to take a journey and move on to my liver. So much for dusting myself off and moving on with life.

So, I now have a lot of time on my hands which allows me to do a lot of thinking...

  I just got back from my vacation on the outer banks of North Carolina where I sat and walked and looked for sea glass, my favorite hobby. As most anyone who has a serious illness will tell you, you spend a lot of time thinking and reflecting on life and death. And it dawned on me while walking last week, that cancer has made me a much kinder, gentler woman. It, like the ocean does to discarded glass, has made me softer, has buffed away my rougher edges. Many relationships have been mended since my diagnosis; many others have gone deeper due to time suddenly not being on my side. My family calls more often. I call more often. Though it has changed my life and those lives around me forever, it has made me thankful for the tumbling and tossing it has done to me - like the glass that fills my jars and my pockets.

  This is again why I wanted to start a blog and have you, if you are interested, follow me as your time and interest allow. In my mind it's a lot like when a group starts out on a walk down the beach together. Little by little, smaller groups form, some walk alone, some catch up to you and walk a while before stopping to pick up a shell or race ahead to someone else. I will be here walking along (at a pretty slow pace!) but join me as you want, when you can. </p>

  <h2>Words of Wisdom From My Hairstylist</h2>
  <!-- Currently having a problem with indentation starting with the 2nd paragraph -->
  <p>My hairstylist, whom I love and adore, has been with me on this cancer journey for two years. We had just gotten my once bald head to sport a blunt bobbed haircut - almost - when cancer struck again. We both cried when we looked in the mirror because we had come so, so close to getting me to look like my pre-cancer self. And then it was gone.

  It was Thanksgiving two years ago after the diagnosis that the cancer had spread,  when I told him to cut it all off. I could see the panic in his eyes, all our hard work literally down the drain. He asked me if I wouldn't consider waiting until after Thanksgiving so as not to shock the family, as it were. But I pushed him and indeed he cut my hair. He is young and dear and I wouldn't trade him for anyone else. And I know him pretty well at this point. He left for a few minutes talked to his mentor composed himself and came back, feeling more positive about the haircut.

  We both got a little teary as he went to work but at the end, he said, "You know what, Miss Sherri?" (Yes, that is what he calls me. I don't think I would let anyone else call me that.) We are just going to 'rock this new haircut' like we wanted it to be this way. NOT because we had to! I love his attitude. So we did.

  Later after Thanksgiving, we brought the clippers out and he shaved my head for chemo. He cried. I cried. We are both so tired of all of this.

  So, almost two years later, I went in yesterday for a color and cut. We have decided to keep it short. I mean really short. I think we are doing it for a couple of reasons. One, to ward away the evil spirits (just kidding) but also when the inevitable scan comes back with bad news, I am already sporting the short cut. That much less to shave in the end.

  I also told him today that I was starting a blog and his beautiful blue eyes widened in surprise!  I told him I know I am an old dog but he waved that off. What he told me was that I had to promise not to sugarcoat anything. That my readers needed to understand that this is in real time with potential real emotions coming out of this keyboard. He suggested I place a disclaimer at the top of the home page! I won't go that far but he made me stop and realize, this may not get pretty and making it pretty would do a disservice to those women who might read this and are struggling with breast cancer. He said you don't want to make it look easy because it's not. He is such a wise man to be so very young.</p>

  <h2>Bucket Lists: Mine and Yours</h2>

  <p>I think a lot about my bucket list.  It probably started after watching the movie <em>The Bucket List </em>starring Morgan Freeman and Jack Nicholson several years ago. At that time, I used the phrase loosely and kept those things in my head that I 'might want to do someday.'  Then when this whole cancer thing came crashing down, I got serious about it and started writing things down. I have a very generous husband who does not want to be mentioned in my blogs so don't mention it, but he has been wonderful in helping me check off some really big items and some very small ones.



  I would urge you to go ahead and make your own list. It would be a good exercise in helping you form what is really important for you to see, do, or accomplish and it also will help you prioritize where to place your time, energy, and money.



  <strong>So far, I have checked off the following items:</strong>

  <ul>

  	<li>Visiting Montreal and practicing my perfectly horrible French on some unsuspecting cab driver</li>

  	<li>Attend one more Eagles concert (although I keep trying to drag this one back on the list, my beloved vetoes it every time!)</li>

  	<li>Eat at the Anchor Bar in Buffalo, NY where they "invented" buffalo wings. Yes, they were delicious. My husband, stepdaughter and her boyfriend came along and we devoured 50!</li>

  	<li>Go to the Caribbean and just sit and look at the blue water. I have never seen such beautiful shades of blue, blue-green. And to our delight we found some seaglass there as well!</li>

  	<li>Go to the Sea Glass beach in northern California. It was amazing! You just walked on seaglass instead of sand. My mother who is seaglass challenged having never been able to find any on her own, asked me to bring her back a bucket of glass (she literally meant a bucket) and I was able to. She just had to sift through the sand and pebbles to find it.</li>

  </ul>

  <strong>What's next?</strong>

  <ul>

  	<li>Living here in upstate New York, I keep hearing about skating on ponds in the winter. Doesn't that sound so Currier and Ives romantic? I know someone special who lives on a BIG pond and she is ready to host me!</li>

  	<li>I want to go down the luge at Lake Placid. My biggest supporter of this trip is my brother-in-law. With his persuasive personality, I keep thinking we will be able to make this a family trip, nieces, nephews and all!</li>

  	<li>I want to see Frank Lloyd Wright's <em>Falling Water</em> home. This will be an easy one as it is just a few hours from my own home.</li>

  	<li>I am a real foodie at heart and want to go to the Culinary Institute of New York and have dinner there. Maybe stay overnight and eat several meals there!</li>

  	<li>And though rather clichéd, I would love to swim with a dolphin. I have loved dolphins since before it was cool, in high school I collected them in glass, wood, and porcelain.</li>

  </ul>

  I really went in depth to get you to start thinking about what you might like to start doing. My urging to you is to start today as we all know, our future is not guaranteed.</p>

  <h2>Bucket List Part 2: The Outrageous and the Letting Go</h2>

  <p>So, since yesterday's post, I have talked to family and friends and they want to know some of the things that I have let go of and  some of my outrageous bucket list items that if I could wave that magical wand, I would make happen. OK, so here goes. (What I am afraid of by doing this is that this list might show more of my strange internal wiring than is necessary!)



  <strong>Things that I have let go of:</strong>

  <ul>

  	<li>I am never going to learn French to the level that I once dreamed of (even with two great friends who are native speakers!)</li>

  	<li>The month of the metastatic diagnosis, I had just completed an application to Loyola for a master's degree in health law; I am so disappointed about letting that go that I still allow them to email me and query my continued interest. But clearly this degree won't happen.</li>

  	<li>Lynne, this is for you: although I pushed through six months of full-time black belt training and completed my project, I moved on from that role and never obtained certification; while I have been given another chance, it seems too daunting to finish that final lap.</li>

  	<li>I will never write a book. I have a quirky southern novel in my head but alas, it will have to remain there.</li>

  	<li>Attending culinary school</li>

  	<li>Being a grandmother</li>

  	<li>I can't go on as I will become too maudlin.</li>

  </ul>

  <strong>My outrageous, need a magic wand for these:</strong>

  <ul>

  	<li>I would love the Eagles to sing Hotel California to me (I told you these were wild) Heck, I 'd let them choose the song!</li>

  	<li>I would love to meet Michael Strahan (former Giants football player and co-host to Kelly Ripa) I am told my mother-in-law can never know this as she is a staunch Eagles fan so if you meet her, keep this under wraps. Why I want to meet him, I don't know. He just seems so likeable. I too, am an Eagles fan.</li>

  	<li>I live 10 minutes from where Tommy Hilfiger grew up and I keep thinking I am going to run into him and he is going to want me to model clothing for his middle age clients. Like he designs anything for middle aged people. Have you ever gone in and looked at the size of the shorts he sells? My linen napkins are larger.</li>

  	<li>I'd like to sing and dance with Jimmy Fallon. Yes, I know I can't sing but in my mind, he won't care! I can keep up with him on the dancing part.</li>

  	<li>I think dinner with Steve Martin would be a crazy good time!</li>

  	<li>I would like to sing back-up (they could turn the microphone off) at a concert of some kind. Anything from a 70's band. My useless knowledge of most all 70's songs is quite extensive. If you don't believe me, ask my in-laws.</li>

  	<li>I would like to be a guest bartender somewhere. I have been told I make a mean margarita and a mean G&amp;T; I have also been told I am a "long pour" and no one would let me tend bar.</li>

  </ul>

  OK, enough of this silliness. Maybe as you are at work on this Friday, you can add to your list and/or come to terms with those things that may need to be let go of so you can spend your time accomplishing what can!]]></content:encoded>

  <h2>My Nemesis NED</h2>

  <p>Although I am not crazy about it, Ned goes everywhere I go. Funny, my husband sort of likes him. Ned lulls him into thinking everything is all right even though all three of us know it is not true. That is the way it often is with metastatic breast cancer. After the shock of the announcement that the cancer has found its way out of your breasts, after the second onslaught of chemo, the second time your husband shaves your head and afterward you put on all of those stupid hats again, it almost becomes routine.

  And then a few months later, your oncologist says with a bright, wide smile, “Your scans show no evidence of disease (NED)” and everyone waits for you to jump up and shout for joy. But you know what? You don’t because unless that proverbial bus creams you on the way to the grocery store one morning, you know how this book ends.

  You don’t know how many chapters are left in the book, true – but you do know who dies in the end. So Ned hops in the car with me as I go about my day and when I meet friends for dinner, one of them will invariably say, “You look so great! You really do! You simply don’t look like you have cancer!” I know she means that as a compliment but I cringe inside as Ned looks on smiling. You see, Ned is a deceiver. He knows that I am not ok, that no matter how much make-up I apply I still don’t have eyelashes. That no matter how good I look, my life is being cut short. I may have two years left, maybe. But Ned is silent – there, but always silent.

  On one of my recent treatment days, Ned was there when a nurse told me that thanks to my reconstruction, I now had the breasts of a nineteen year old! I know she meant it as a compliment to offset an otherwise dreadful situation but I wanted to smack her and Ned both. Though my breasts are indeed beautiful, my chest wall, not to mention my right arm is numb. Completely numb. My reconstruction is all for show. When I am in a foul mood, I say my breasts are useless. Ned knows this and doesn’t care.

  Though I can carry on polite conversation in almost any situation, despite my disease and treatment regimen, Ned is right behind me watching. Case in point – I am a nurse but can no longer work full-time. At a hospital function a few months ago, a pharmacist who didn’t know my background asked me what I did with all my time since I didn’t work. Ned grinned. I told her without any drama, well maybe a little for effect, that when I wasn’t volunteering at a local hospital, I was getting treatment for breast cancer. “Well, you look great!” Ah, yes. I do look great.



  To tell you the truth the only way I get through conversations like the above mentioned is the satisfaction in knowing that at some time in the not so distant future, when my cancer returns, Ned dies. And I will be rid of him forever. No more lingering around, sitting on my shoulder, going with me everywhere I go. I guess in a way I do get to have the last word when it comes to Ned. Though the irony of the situation when this occurs is  not lost on me.

  <h2>PET Scan Today</h2>

  <p>Well, I have been rather crabby for the past two days prepping for my PET scan. Why? Well let me list the things for you that I have not been able to eat for a day and a half: potatoes, rice, bread, alcohol, juice, soft drinks, coffee, any sugar. Are you kidding me? Even though my beloved tried to pacify me with a nice juicy steak last night, which did taste really good, but  how good could it be when I had it with green beans and a glass of water!?!




Whine...whine. So, I got up this morning (without coffee) and drove through the lovely hills of upstate New York and checked in with Radiology. When I was taken back 'on the truck' and an IV started, the radioactive isotopes injected, I was told I needed to lie perfectly still for an hour and that I could not read anything, in any form! Wow! And he left.

So I lay there and wondered how long or how short would an hour be for me? And what should I do? Except move. So, I thought I should at least pray for a while. I had tried to have my devotional time before I headed out. I don't know about you but without two cups of black, strong coffee under my belt in the morning, the rapture could occur and I would be like, "Hey, where are we going? What just happened? I'm not awake yet." But I prayed - for many of you, for my son and then before I knew it, I had fallen asleep. Many of you are not surprised.

Then I was taken back and pushed and pulled through that CT doughnut of a machine. Those can be long minutes when you wish with all your might that you could know right then and there if they are seeing something - but you can't and you don't. You just lie there and listen to the worst music ever.

Afterward, he got me up, handed me some gluten free cookies (don't get me started on that) and out the door I went.

I drove back through the hills, clutching the first cup of coffee that I have had in 48 hours like it was gold. Now the hardest part, not the IV stick, not the claustrophobic CT machine but the wait.

So since I am radioactive until nightfall, I thought I would post this blog which is a lot of nothing (!) and wait for dinner filled with carbohydrates!

I will let you know in a few days the results of the scan...</p>

  <h2>Home Away From Home</h2>

  <p>My southern friends often ask me how I am faring "up there in the north." To many of my friends and family, they can't conceive of living above that ole Mason-Dixon line. They are worried that having cancer while living in foreign land must be more than I can bear. Sometimes, I really go for it and say, "Can you believe we live only three hours away from <em>Canada</em>?!" I try to make it sound as dramatic as possible. I am known for that.

  My southern friends and family heard me complain about a certain southern city I lived in when my cancer was first diagnosed, where the mastectomies occurred, where my first round of chemo occurred, where I fell on my icy deck and had the largest cerebral hematoma anyone had ever seen that didn't require a trip to the Operating Room. The same city that in the spring when all of this cancer tragedy had subsided, I walked out on the same deck and fell right through it - literally - bearing a nasty scar on my shin to this day. I remember screaming to my husband, "Get me out of this damn city! I can't stand it any longer!" And sure enough he did. Because he is that way.

  And before I knew it many months later, I jumped in my car and drove to Corning, New York. I didn't look once in the rearview mirror at that southern city I was leaving. Oh, the relief I felt that day, I cannot describe. For my southern folks, the picture above is downtown Corning. This is the little oasis that we found ourselves living in when six months into our new apartment, I was diagnosed with terminal cancer. I thought we had left cancer behind in the south. This was to be our fresh start. Yet, as Yogi Berra said, "It was deja vu all over again."

  But I am here to tell you, the experience  of having cancer this time was a totally different experience. You see, although only a resident of Corning for six months, I already felt like a member of the community. I was working at Corning Hospital (right across the street from where we lived at the time!) and already felt like a part of the hospital team. Because downtown is only about five blocks long, shopkeepers already knew me - I was supported in every way possible.

  I have never lived anywhere so small - my residences have included  Manhattan, Washington, DC, New Haven, CT, smaller but still larger than Corning places like Raleigh and Winston-Salem, NC. But never in a place where people driving by will call out your name and wave! When I walk up and down Market Street (that's the street in the picture) shopkeepers will wave to me from their stores! I know it sounds like the perfect place and it is in my mind. My stepdaughter came to visit last year, born and raised in Philadelphia, she turned to me and said, "This place is idyllic." Yes! That's the word I had been searching for.

  I love it here. My heart is here and I have encouraged all of my friends and family to come and visit. Every one that has driven or flown in to visit say the same thing, "This place is wonderful!" No surprise that Rand McNally gave it the title "Most Fun Small Town in America!"</P>

  <h2>The Results are In</h2>

  <p>The results of the PET scan are in and I have had a couple of conversations today with my oncologist, whom I adore. What I like most about her (besides the fact that she was a nurse and then went back to medical school) is that she is willing to listen to her right brain when she needs to. It was her right brain that told her two years ago that something wasn't right with me when there was nothing to indicate that there was anything wrong except that I continued to complain about fatigue. She talked me into CT scans and the rest, as they say, is history.

Today she told me that the PET scan shows that there are two lesions on my liver but because we don't have an old PET scan to compare it to, we do not know if they are old or new. But this is where her right brain kicks in that I appreciate. She said her gut tells her something is brewing, that the current medication I am on every three weeks isn't stopping these two lesions from being 'active.' So the plan is for me to add hormonal therapy to my regimen. It will hopefully take away the "fuel" aka estrogen that might be feeding these lesions.

And then another PET scan in 8-12 weeks. If the PET shows activity at that point, I along with my beloved who does not want to be talked about in this blog, will have to decide if I will go back on chemo. Until then, I will continue to ramble here in my blog.

Don't worry. I am fine. It is a beautiful day in Corning. I am sitting here doing the very non-southern thing and drinking a G&amp;T after Labor Day. You do know that you do not wear white pants nor drink G&amp;Ts after Labor Day, right?</p>

  <h2>My Homework</h2>

  <p>Everyone has said, "You are handling this much better than I ever would." They don't know that for sure. I believe everyone has a reservoir of strength that is waiting to be tapped for something - climbing a mountain, childbearing, surgery, any number of stressful situations I can think of. But I want to tell you a couple of months ago, I hit a real low. I had come in to the hospital for a meeting and someone in an office yelled out a greeting like they do in Corning, remember? And though I said hello back, I did not go in to the office and chat. Looking back, I am not sure why. And three hours or so later this person was dead. And I began to cry. A colleague to be sure but not someone I was particularly close to. But I cried. And cried.  Long after  my work friends who had known this person for years had stopped crying, I was still crying.

  Then a couple of weeks later, I was at a leadership meeting and a video was shown of our  hospital construction and I began to cry in the dark. What is wrong with me, I kept thinking. Afterward, when the room emptied,  two of my closest friends and confidants came over and I just wept. One of them said, "I think you need to see someone." And so I did.

  Everything is so close here in Corning which is why I love it. From dry cleaning to sushi, just step outside on Market Street and start walking. You will get there in no time. So I walked over to this large lovely home, now a counseling center and waited, wondering what I was going to say. "Isn't everyone with terminal cancer supposed to be teary?" she might think. The answer is no! I looked up and there she was. We walked upstairs to her office. Lovely office sitting up in the trees. She was so poised and quiet. So I told her my story of the sudden death of a co-worker and it dawned on me as things often do in a counseling office I suppose, that I came face-to-face with death that day and it extended to my own death. Duh.

  Her counsel was simple and powerful. This is what she said:

  <ul>

  	<li>Your body is slowing down, preparing itself for death currently through the forgetfulness, the instability in your gait…it will increase and change as you come nearer and nearer.</li>

  	<li>You’ve been pushing it and pushing it and your body is saying, “It is time to focus inward, and to settle yourself.”</li>

  	<li>Your body cannot and should not be trying to keep up with anyone who is healthy. You cannot do it and it is showing you that.</li>

  	<li>It is time to stop taking care of everyone, friends and family, trying to make sure everyone is ready for your death. It is time to focus inward on yourself and prepare for what is coming.</li>

  </ul>

  I walked out into the late afternoon back to the apartment with some kind of burden that had been sitting on me, lifted. No more crying like that. In the end, do you know what she told me? Start a blog.</p>

  <h2>Joan Lunden, Call Me</h2>

  <p>A friend asked me the other day if I would run out of things to write about! Are you kidding me? I will be long gone and will still have ideas sitting in my "draft" box that this website keeps for me. I promised my mother I would not do anything edgy before October breast cancer awareness month (ugh) but standing in line at Wegmans yesterday I knew there would be no holding back once I got home. You see, as I stood there in line, beautiful, bald Joan Lunden stared back at me on the cover of People magazine with the quote, "I will beat this!" It made me so angry I just had to look away. I wanted to speed dial her and set her straight. I imagined she would pick up the phone and I would say, "Joan. Listen, you have it all wrong. <strong>You</strong> don't get to decide if you will beat cancer - <strong>the cancer does</strong>." And then I would go on to educate her on cancer that stays in the breast versus cancer that leaves it and what a disservice it is to women and families who deal with the diagnosis of terminal breast cancer and how they might worry that they had not fought as hard as say, Joan Lunden and that's why they were dying. Oh, I've gone and gotten myself started!

  I will close to say or maybe it is a disclaimer: October is a rough month for women who are living and dying with metastatic breast cancer. I have so much I want to write about but will wait.

  The ribbon you see above is the ribbon for metastatic breast cancer. I think the colors are befitting.</p>

  <h2>A Mist That Vanishes</h2>

  <p>I have been in Manhattan since Saturday having the time of my life. One of my favorite cities, I am fortunate enough to live four hours away so an easy drive (well, until you get about 20 miles from the city and then you can imagine). My first trip to New York was when I was in high school. I fell in love instantly. I thought it was the most magical place on earth.  The hustle, the bustle, the fashion. I still wonder how women trek through the streets of Manhattan in stilettos.

We are here as my better half sits on a national advisory board of physicians, nurses, IT folks and so on who come together twice a year to discus patient safety issues. They have been kind enough to let me tag along for a couple of years. This is the group that I write articles for that pertain to patient engagement (for you in healthcare you will learn a lot  by logging on to <a title="Engaging Patients" href="http://engaingpatients.org/" target="_blank">engagingpatients.org.</a>)

I have to admit though that when the meetings are in session, sometimes I am acutely aware of my career being over as I am on the other side of the door. I also often feel this way when my husband comes home from work or a friend stops by for a drink and I want to know all about the things that are happening in the hospital and as you can imagine that's the last thing they want to talk about!

So, this morning while these folks are in session, I sat down in my window seat overlooking Wall Street and read my devotional. It never ceases to amaze me how on target some of these are. Today's verse out of the book of James is one of my favorites, "You are a mist that appears for a little while and then vanishes." While that might make some readers sad,  it actually gives me comfort. For you see, no matter how much I want to get out there and grab every last minute of New York (or the world for that matter) I am tired today. So, I am not. I am going to rest and wait until this evening to have dinner and then have conversation with those folks who are behind the closed doors. We are all mist. Knowing that I can't do everything, releases the stress from me allowing me to do some things.</p>

  <h2>Melissa Versus Aretha</h2>

  <p>So a friend and a stranger (who is now a friend) read my bucket list blog, the one list that required a wand to make a dream happen and they decided to get me tickets to see Kelly Ripa, but more importantly Michael Strahan. Unbeknownst to me, they worked on it a couple of weeks. (Who knew it would be such an endeavor?) By the time I left for Manhattan last Saturday, they told me they had secured tickets and that I needed to confirm them via email. But by the time I arrived in my hotel and clicked on the "accept" button, the tickets had been given to someone else.
I was SO disappointed and continued to try and log on through the weekend as I was told tickets could open up at any minute. On Sunday, we went to one of my haunts which is a pizza place beside the Ed Sullivan Theater on Broadway which just happens to be where David Letterman tapes his shows. There was a young woman on the sidewalk who asked me if I wanted to get tickets to the show but I was so hungry I told here I'd be back after lunch!
When I went back to tell her that yes, I would like to see a taping, I was then told it was a lottery system. (Here we go again, I thought.) What the heck. I filled out the form and left.  A few hours later, I got a call that I had gotten a ticket and the next day I found myself sitting in the theater. I had googled who was going to be on the  show and was less than enthusiastic about the guests but what I really wanted to see were the behind the scenes action anyway.
I was seated beside a very interesting man who ended up telling me he was a hairstylist from Miami and by the way he said, "Your short haircut looks faaaabulous!" Little did he know, right Dustin? He then turned to me and said, "I heard that the guest was Aretha Franklin!" Well, that definitely wasn't on the list when I googled it.

And I am sure you know by now that she came out in an aqua ball gown with her own band and five back up singers and belted out "Rolling in the Deep" with a little "Aint No Mountain High Enough" thrown in for good measure!
Can I just tell you though I appreciate her contribution to music, I can't say as I was a fan. But the audience was electrified.  If you google " Aretha and David Letteman" you will see dozens of article and posts about that song. At the end, the audience jumped up and gave her a heart felt standing ovation. I was really overcome. I felt so fortunate to have been in that room yesterday.
This morning, I woke up and turned on Kelly and Michael to see who/what I was missing since this was the  morning that I was hopefully going to be there. Please no one take offense if you are a fan but the singer was Melissa Ethridge....hmmmm...I do believe when God closes the door, he can open up a big, wide window.  And through that window, I heard Aretha sing.</p>

  <h2>Joan Lunden Blog as posted on The Metastatic Breast Cancer Network</h2>

  <p>Joan Lunden, Give Me a Call
    I promised my mother I would not do anything edgy before October breast cancer awareness month (ugh), but standing in line at Wegmans yesterday I knew there would be no holding back once I got home.

    You see, as I stood there in line, beautiful, bald Joan Lunden stared back at me on the cover of People magazine with the quote, “I will beat this!” It made me so angry I just had to look away. I wanted to speed dial her and set her straight. I imagined she would pick up the phone and I would say,
    “Joan. Listen, you have it all wrong. You don’t get to decide if you will beat cancer – the cancer does.”
    And then I would go on to educate her on cancer that stays in the breast versus cancer that leaves it and what a disservice it is to women and families who deal with the diagnosis of terminal breast cancer and how they might worry that they had not fought as hard as say, Joan Lunden, and that’s why they were dying. Oh, I’ve gone and gotten myself started!
    October is a rough month for women who are living and dying with metastatic breast cancer. I have so much I want to write about! Stay tuned.</p>

  <h2>There Is An Elephant in the Room This Month and It’s Pink</h2>

  <p>You know what month this is, right? How could you not with all of the bubblegum pink everywhere on everything. For many of us living with metastatic breast cancer, it is our least favorite time of year for a variety of reasons. But though the month of October is dedicated to breast cancer awareness month, October 13 is the one day dedicated to the disease that is actually killing us. Think about this statement:
    “No one dies from breast cancer that remains in the breast. Metastasis occurs when cancer cells travel to a vital organ and that is what threatens life.”
    I remember when I read that statement for the first time. It was like the proverbial light went on. Now I knew why I was always irritated when I saw women in pink tutus walking in those “we are survivors” breast cancer races. As well intentioned as both the women and the races are, many of those women who are so excited to call themselves “survivors” really aren’t survivors! Ouch. I know I step on toes by saying it but the truth of the matter is this, if the cancer doesn’t leave the breast, you don’t die from the disease. You get to die from something else. The statement from above is taken from an organization that I would bet many people have never heard of: The Metastatic Breast Cancer Network http://mbcn.org/  whose slogan is, “fighting for treatments to extend life.” Note that it does not say to survive breast cancer or to beat breast cancer because if you currently have metastatic breast disease the focus is on control of the disease and the quality of life that remains. Remember, we know how this cancer book ends. We know who dies in the end.

    Those of us, around 155,000 living with metastatic disease in the US, aren’t typically the ones in tutus racing through the streets of America. We are too tired, too sick, too tethered by IV tubing to our local hospitals to do much dancing. This is how you can help: To see women who are living and dying with metastatic breast disease as a very different patient population from the women who have experienced ductal carcinoma in situ breast disease (cancer inside the breast). After my double mastectomy, a nurse practitioner once told me, “Don’t ever let a woman who has had a simple lumpectomy tell you that she knows how you feel. Because she doesn’t.”
    Until I was diagnosed with metastatic disease, I did not know that only 2% of the annual cancer fund of $5 billion is slated for Stage IV cancers of which breast metastasis is a subset. It has taken me a while to appreciate the fact that the “pink ribbon breast disease” as I call it is the pretty disease. Metastatic disease is not. It is the ugly disease. We are the group of women who scare the ladies in pink tutus because we are dying from the disease that they are running scared from. We  are the women that are ignored by the pink ribbon organizations because we are living examples that you can do everything right and still die from breast cancer. We are the reminders that you can have your screening mammogram every year, without fail, just like I did, and still have invasive cancer diagnosed after your annual mammogram. We make other women uncomfortable. And I believe that is why so infinitesimal is the money given for metastatic disease research.
    Let me put it another way. Do we really need more money funded for breast cancer awareness campaigns? Who in heaven’s name is not aware of breast cancer? What we need is money funding the disease that is killing 44,000 of us in the US annually. Soon it will be me. Which is why I write and which is why I am asking you to come to grips with the two diseases. And acknowledge that one size does not fit all. You can do all the self-breast exams you want; you can get an annual screening mammogram; you can do everything in your power to thwart the disease but if it is going to get you, it is going to get you. Early diagnosis does not equal survival. Good girls are not the ones who get screened and don’t get breast cancer just as the bad girls are not the ones who get the screenings and still go on to get the disease.
    We need to shift our paradigms and take a stand that money be shifted as well to finding the cures for the disease. It’s too late for me but not for someone close to you. A future child? A future grandchild? October 13 is dedicated to those of us who won’t get out of this alive - National Metastatic Breast Disease Day.</p>

  <h2>The Source Of My Humor and Storytelling?</h2>

  <p>I have been asked over the past few weeks where my humor comes from and how I learned to "story tell" as someone called my writing. Well, it may start with the picture that you see here. I am the younger girl in the photo and my sidekick is my aunt, Marie. All of eight years older than me. Old enough to be dating when I couldn't, young enough to take me to the local 7-11 and spend money on me for candy. And oh did we buy candy. My silver filled teeth can testify to that. I was really like the 5th child in line. My mom had me young and she being the oldest had three younger siblings and then came me. Marie being the fourth child,  I am closer in age to her than she is to my mom,  her sister - hence this relationship.
  Marie is funny. If you don't believe it, ask her to do her "wide-mouth frog" routine. Or her "wishy washy" routine. She was so cool. I would watch her go to football games in the late '60's while I hung back with her mother, my grandmother. I loved to  spend weekend nights with Nannie as I called her.  Though I hated Lawrence Welk, she kept poptarts in the cupboard for Marie and my Uncle Bill and when I was there I could have two if I wanted! Nirvana!
  I would often sleep in Marie's bed when I visited (when I wasn't in my Aunt Susan's bed - I would go back and forth) and if I could keep myself awake til midnight or whenever she came in, she would tell me the story about  Smokey the Bear fighting forest fires. I have NO idea where she got the idea for that one but over and over and over again I would ask her to tell me that story. And she complied every time without complaint.
  So maybe it was trying to emulate her through my formative years that laid the foundation for the humor and the writing. All I know is that she along with Aunt Susan are regular readers of this blog and for that, I am thankful.

  PS: Marie just texted me. Still very cool for a grandmother of four - and she said after she read this post, it reminded her of me coming home with them most Sundays after church. And the first thought I had was, "Oh shoot a monkey!" Which is another phrase she still says (no PETA people, we don't have monkeys in my home state of NC, nor did Marie and I go out hunting them.) Because then I had another memory of fried chicken every week. And because I was the youngest and oh so adorable (!) I got to choose which side of the "pully bone" to choose to make my wish come true. Aunt Marie and Uncle Bill occasionally got irritated that they didn't get to choose, but there are some advantages of being the first grand child. So, we would pull and pull until one of us had won. Oh they were good ole days.</p>

  <h2>Mammography: What I Bet You Didn’t Know</h2>

  <p>There has been a lot of controversy about mammograms in the past few years. Some heralding them as life savers, some wanting them to be done on younger and younger patients and so on. The woman you see here is probably familiar to you. Her name is Amy Robach and she used to be an anchor on NBC's Today Show. Then she moved over to Good Morning America. She recently had her first mammogram and they  found a mass. She is currently seeking treatment. She has stated publicly that the    mammogram saved her life. Hmm... Listen to what the renowned breast surgeon, Dr. Susan Love  http://www.dslrf.org/breastcancer/  author of the definitive book on breast cancer entitled,  Dr. Susan Love's Breast Book said in response:
  “Did the mammogram save her life, as one doctor was quoted as saying? The answer, of course, is we don’t know. While mammography is capable of finding about 26% of cancers at a point where it makes a life-saving difference in the outcome, it also finds many lesions which would never have gone on to be life-threatening and others which will still be life-threatening in spite of early detection and rigorous screening."
  "The problem is not the mammogram as a detection tool, but the natural history of the disease, which brings us to the crucial point…not all breast cancers are the same. Before a treatment is prescribed or chosen, it is critical that a woman or man knows what kind of breast cancer they have of the roughly 5-7 kinds we can now recognize. There are probably many more kinds that we just don’t know about or know how to recognize yet. The behavior of the cancer is dictated not as much by when it is found as by what kind it is and how that kind usually behaves. This information informs the decisions about treatment. …"
  "We all need to help tone down the hype that mammograms are the be-all/end-all life-saving tool and stop fueling mass fear that a questionable mammogram is a potential death sentence.”
  Dr. Loves' book is highly readable whether you have breast cancer or not. What I learned from her interview is that mammography is not as straightforward as the public believes.

  <h2>A Question From My Son</h2>

  <p>I have one child - a handsome 23 year old who is finishing up a degree to begin work as a paramedic. He is equally skilled in the kitchen. I think he will make a wonderful catch for someone but I digress. He lives in NC where he attends school so sadly our communication comes from texts, calls and visits every few months. It was last summer when he came to the beach house and after a swim, dinner and a soak in the hot tub, he walked into my bedroom. I was sitting on the side of the bed; he walked over, put his arms around me and said nothing for a long time. It was so good to be near him. I miss him terribly; for many reasons he and I were extremely close when he was growing up. The two years  I spent  homeschooling him, he recently told me were the two best years of his childhood. Wow.
  That night, he turned to me and asked, "What is it like living between two worlds -  one foot on earth and one foot in heaven?" If you know my son, you are not surprised at the depth of that kind of question. His preschool teacher used to call him her philosopher at the ripe old age of four. Another mentor called him his little theologian.
  I told him I hadn't thought of it that way but indeed that is exactly how I feel. I really don't sweat the small stuff anymore. I am freed by a lot of the things that you, the reader, are not. I no longer try to envision what living in a nursing home would be like. The stock market has no effect on me. I no longer wonder when I can retire. I no longer wonder what I will look like at 70, 80. I tell people I love them freely. I eat ice cream any time I want.
  I am much more focused on my movement toward heaven as time slips by and I am very cognizant of every day, of everything.  I experience things so acutely now. The leaves turning this fall have never been more beautiful. The river that runs through out town never lovelier. Every time my son calls, when he texts me that he loves me, I am overwhelmed with love for him, for others, for God. I am not sure how much time I have and yes I do feel like I am living in two worlds. I am at peace with that.</p>

  <h2>Women of Faith</h2>

  <p>I saw my oncologist today. She and I are  women of  faith. When we are alone, we discuss the human and spiritual dimensions of this disease and where it is taking me, my husband and my extended family. I am so thankful for her. She is young and wise and takes all the time I need when I am struggling. We have both been tearful together; we pray for each other. I am deeply blessed to have her overseeing my care.

  But when I say faith, I know that means different things to different people. I feel I owe it to you my family and friends to explain what I mean. Yes, I grew up in the south where some would say, it's easy for you to claim faith, as everyone 'down there' goes to church. I agree that many do go to church but as a minister once said, "walking into a church doesn't make you a Christian anymore than walking into a garage makes you a car." I heard that as a young person and thought it was funniest thing I had ever heard at the time.

  <strong>These are the things I believe:</strong>

  <ul>

  	<li>I believe there is a  God who orchestrated the heaven and earth. I am not hung up on evolution.</li>

  	<li>I believe the world has fallen into sin from the very beginning. I am not hung up on a real or an extended six-day creation.</li>

  	<li>I believe that for every sin, there must be a payment for that sin (if you hate that word, substitute 'wrongdoing').</li>

  	<li>Until God sent his son, Jesus, to be the ultimate payment for Sin (any and all and everyone's) there was a separation between God and man.</li>

  	<li>Christ came, lived and then died for our sins. Every last one of them. Which is why we no longer bring birds, bulls, calves to the altar.</li>

  	<li>I believe he arose after three days. I really, really do. An actual resurrection.</li>

  	<li>Christ is the bridge between God and man.</li>

  	<li>I believe that as the scripture says, that He has gone to make a place for me (for me!) in heaven. I can't wait to see what my room looks like in that mansion. I'm thinking a fireplace in my bedroom with a Siamese cat sleeping at the foot of my bed, just waiting on me. We'll see!</li>

  	<li>I do believe in an actual heaven and actual hell. No, I do not believe that everyone will go to heaven.</li>

  	<li>No, I do not believe that there are many ways to heaven through many different spiritual paths.</li>

  	<li>Going to heaven is easy. The only thing you have to do is accept that you are a sinner (To me that is easy as I have done SO much wrong in my life) and that you need to be forgiven for your sins. I don't know  about you but I would rather trust/acknowledge that Jesus is my payment rather than the herd of cattle I would have to bring to the altar way back in the day. And then through prayer, ask Him to be your savior.</li>

  	<li>When I pray, I am praying to the author of the universe and I believe that He is listening.</li>

  	<li>Does this confession and acceptance as Christ as savior make your life easier? No.</li>

  	<li>Does this protect you from all harm and disease? Again, a big No.</li>

  	<li>Will believing help you get through all of the disease, disappointment, disillusion of the world? A big yes.</li>

  	<li>Is it ever too late to become a believer? Absolutely not.</li>

  	<li>Are there any sins too horrific to be forgiven for? No.</li>

  </ul>

  I feel better just letting you know where I stand. He is what gets me through the days. He is who I cry out to. He is who gives me spiritual comforting that weaves with the human comforting I get from my husband, my friends and my family. In this day and age of diversity and doing your own thing, I know it all seems square. I  get it - assurance of salvation.</p>

  <h2>The End is Near</h2>

  <p>This past weekend the town of Corning hosted its annual marathon wine glass festival. Above you see the sweet faces of my two stepdaughters. One was running and the other injured, is just coming along side her sister at the finish line. They are great young women who have welcomed me into their family with much grace. I love to have them come and visit. The one on the right is the one from several posts back who  labeled the town of Corning, "idyllic."  And I must add one boyfriend who joins in as well. They are three dynamite people and when I sit and have a glass of wine with them, I feel I am young again. They laugh at the stupid things I say. We talk about everything and they tolerate my belting out '70's hits on the radio when we go exploring up in the finger lakes wine region which we always seem to do.

  They have been so, so patient with me through this blog adventure and especially through the month of October. When something I find obnoxious comes on the television at night, I don't even have to ask their permission to mute the screen. They know I cannot take very much during this month.

  While their dad, my husband who does not want to be mentioned, the boyfriend and I drank mimosas Sunday morning while we waited on Heather (right) to finish. We noticed a woman near the finish line that held out a bright orangish sign that simply read, "The end is near." It caught me as hilariously  funny as a non-runner and knowing that my own end is near (I didn't need a middle-aged woman holding a sign to remind me!) But she stood there for at least 45 minutes to the point that the dear boyfriend, who is a phenomenal photographer I might add, slipped outside to take her photograph holding the sign. Come to find out in the running world, wacky signs toward the finish line are not uncommon. I just found it ironic and hilarious that she chose outside my restaurant window to remind me of something I already know!</p>

  <h2>My Golden Girls</h2>

  <p>
    I am off this weekend to see two childhood chums. Between the three of us, we have <strong>not</strong> had a lot of down time. Between the three of us we have 92 years of marriage logged under our belts six college/advanced degrees, each of us has one child a piece. That to me has always been  interesting to note. One came by surprise, one by adoption and one through perseverance.  We wouldn't trade them. We grew up in the 60's when lunch was 30 cents, where we spent a lot of time outdoors and a lot of time talking about boys.

    One friend I met in the first grade. She was THE popular girl with long wavy black hair. She was the 'girlfriend' of the most handsome six year old I could imagine back then. (We didn't know Donny Osmond at that point.) She took dance lessons of which I coveted and later as a young adult had to ask forgiveness for as I had buried that covertness in my heart for a lot of years. The only dancing I did was when I took the trash out or when Soul Train came on Saturday afternoons. I remember in the second grade while learning mythology (why were we learning mythology when the Viet Nam war was going on? I still don't know). She was chosen as Helen of Troy (I should have known). I was back-up Aphrodite. "Oh" but the teacher said, "She is the goddess of love and beauty!" Like I didn't know that I was still second fiddle. But my friend was never one to taunt her first grade fame. She is and has always been modest.

    The other friend, I met in the fourth grade at the water fountain. She came careening around the corner and stopped. She looked at me and said,  Don't you just hate it when your slip hangs out beneath your dress?" I thought, "Who are you,  and I am not sure I even own a slip!" And she has been my friend ever since and continues to pull at her slip.

    I love them. We survived being bussed across town back and forth every two years. And though our closeness has waxed and waned as all long term friendships do, breast cancer for two of the three of us has cemented our middle years together.  I love them both. We are three very different people but we share a common southern background that no one can take from us. Sadly, we  recently came together for one of our mother's funerals. It was a mix of happy and sad. We hadn't all been in the same room in 15 years? I  am just guessing.

    I am a firm believer in the saying that new friends are like silver, the old ones gold. They are my 'golden girls.'</p>

    <h2>Sabrina Has Left the Building</h2>

    <p>When I return for my next infusion at the Cancer Center,  my nurse of two years will not be there. For two years, she and I have had a date every third week for the better part of a morning (or afternoon). I met her two Thanksgivings ago when it was time to start chemo again. I remember staring out a window, teary-eyed and in disbelief when Sabrina walked into my cubicle. I turned around to meet her and when she saw me weepy, she hugged me right off the bat. Little did I know that Sabrina does not do that very often. I don't think that she realized at that moment that she was staring into the eyes of someone with newly diagnosed metastatic disease and when I reminded her, her eyes conveyed a more knowing and sympathetic look. My second port of which she got the privilege of accessing was far more tender and so swollen as compared to my first one that I didn't think I would make it through that morning but I did. Thanks to her wicked sense of humor and her tenacity.

    In Virginia, I was used to lying down to have chemo and here, there is only one bed and many recliners. Although she didn't fully understand why I was so attached to that one bed, she made sure that if it was within her power, she would have that bed ready for me. A true patient advocate. And seeing someone every third week, one gets to know someone very quickly. And she and I became fast friends both as women but also as nurses.  She said one of the toughest things she has done in her career is break the shell of my better half but like I say, her wit and her zaniness, even he couldn't resist. We became a trio.

    When I went through my rough patch after my colleague died (written about several posts ago) I cried a lot that day during my infusion. It was tough on her I think because I have been pretty upbeat throughout these past two years but that day she was stressed because I was stressed and I continued to think what a great and empathetic nurse she was.

    But as in life, all good things must come to an end. She once told me she didn't look forward to my demise as we have become so close. And then she told me last month that she had accepted an offer in another healthcare organization. I told her based on my last PET scan, she was getting out just in time. Our humor is that way. I will really miss her and am getting all choked up as I write. But I know she reads this blog - she affectionately calls it stalking me. So, Sabrina, thank you for taking such good care of me - for meeting all my needs. Thank you for not holding back the <em>candy</em> when I needed it. I will miss you dearly.</p>

    <h2>Metastatic Breast Cancer Alliance: October 2014 Executive Summary</h2>

    <p>Today's post comes from the  Metastatic Breast Cancer Alliance <a title="Metatstatic Breast Cancer Alliance" href="http://www.mbcalliance.org" target="_blank">www.mbcalliance.org </a>October 2014 Executive Summary entitled, <em>Changing the Landscape for People Living with Metastatic Breast Cancer.  </em>I know some of what you will read, I have mentioned in previous posts but this is so important. Thank you for indulging me during the month of October:

    "A greater understanding of what MBC is and how it differs from early stage breast cancer is needed among patients, their families and healthcare providers, researchers, and the public.

    <ul>

    	<li>The focus on "fighting" and "beating" breast cancer has led to the creation and dominance of a breast cancer "survivor" which masks the reality that women who have had early stage breast cancer can develop metastatic disease.</li>

    	<li>The focus on screening and survivorship can stigmatize patients who experience a recurrence or are diagnosed at stage IV - they may be perceived to be at fault for the cancer's progression.</li>

    	<li>The effects of public and professional misconceptions or lack of understanding about metastatic breast cancer  can negatively influence decisions made by patients and their doctors regarding treatment and quality of life.</li>

    	<li>More can be done to build the understanding of  healthcare providers about how to discuss treatments and quality of life, including palliation of their patients."</li>

    </ul>

    <strong>This quote resonates with me so much:</strong>

    <p>“We did nothing wrong. Our medical team did nothing wrong. Metastatic breast cancer happens...at any time...regardless of your age, whether you did chemo[therapy], radiation, had a mastectomy, had a bilateral mastectomy, ate well, took vitamins, exercised regularly, prayed, had positive thoughts, had negative thoughts, got regular mammograms, did self- exams religiously, had a tiny stage 1 primary tumor, or a stage 0 primary tumor, or a stage 3 primary tumor, or never even had primary breast cancer. <strong>It doesn’t matter</strong>.” —MBCN website (emphasis mine).</p>

    <h2>Now, Meet My Silver Girls</h2>

    <p>Lest you think from my "golden girls" post that those two are the only ones I care about, you would be wrong. I want to introduce you to my two <em>silver</em> <em>girls</em>. These two I have been friends with for all of five years. I met them both when I lived in Connecticut. I hold them dear to my heart. They are both physicians which impresses the socks right off of me. Women who were able to navigate medical school back when it wasn't shall we say so 'diverse'? I marvel at their intellect. But they are also a boatload of fun.

    The first friend is an epidemiologist and I got to know her when I worked at Yale-New Haven Hospital. She and I co-led the hospital hand hygiene initiative which sounds like a real yawn unless you had sat through our presentation/lecture. By the time we had taught around 300 people, we had our song and dance down pat and the audience loved us, if I do say so myself! If being a physician isn't impressive enough, she is also from French descent and speaks it fluently. She is an avid runner and has a physique that I will never have. And she loves a good strong margarita. Yes, she sounds almost perfect!

    My other friend, also a physician, is the Director of Patient Safety at the hospital association where I also worked. She has a keen mind for details and can coordinate huge programs to accommodate members from all 28 hospitals across the state. She always has a kind word and has a way of navigating through difficult work situations with aplomb. She is elegant and thoughtful. The best part about her? She, too, loves a good margarita!

    I feel like I am the luckiest girl in CT when we three get together. Over the last year, I had been driving back into New Haven to volunteer at Yale about once a month. To be frank, I was not ready to leave Connecticut when we did but that's life. I believe it also symbolizes "health" to me as I was diagnosed almost immediately after moving from CT to Virginia.  So, I go back. I walk the shore across the street from my former home on the Long Island sound. I collect seaglass as I walk. I drive down and  get harassed at the local Italian restaurant by two of the long time bartenders. If you let them harass you long enough, they will pour you a glass of wine on the house, so why wouldn't I just sit there and take it for a few minutes? And then I go out with my two silver girls.

    We have gone to different places but the one that I think we all three lean toward is an upscale Mexican restaurant near the hospital. (If you are ever there, it is Geronimo, their website is: <a title="Geronimo" href="http://geronimobarandgrill.com" target="_blank"><em>geronimobarandgrill.com</em></a> ) They serve the best margaritas and some of the best Mexican food I have ever eaten. We typically get a high top table  near the bar, and order the guacamole made tableside and along with the margaritas and talking to those two, I think I am in heaven. In fact, if heaven were like that, I would be perfectly happy.

    Since I am at Yale just about 48 hours when I go, we can get together once. So we end up talking at rapid fire speed to get in all that we need to get in before I leave. These two are precious to me because although I didn't grow up with them, they cared for me long distance during the dark days of surgery and chemo in Virginia. They sent cards, cookies, emails. One of them decided I needed some spring in my long dark winter here in NY during my second series of chemo and sent me a half dozen jewel-toned scarves to wrap up in. They are too good to me.

    So the three of us are figuring out how to get together. I am having more difficulty making the 10 hour round trip to Connecticut. I think they may be coming to upstate New York  before the holidays. I can hardly wait. Though there are no restaurants to compare to Geronimo here, I am known for being able to make a mean margarita!</p>

    <h2>My Yaya's: Somewhere Between the Golden Girls and the Silver Girls</h2>

    <p>One last group of women that need to be brought forward and recognized are my ya-ya's. Who? Do you remember the 2002 movie starring Sandra Bullock called The <em>Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood</em>? I bet many of you do. Well, at Cone Hospital there were five of us in perioperative leadership that constituted the ya-yas. One was the director of the Operating Room. She had been working in the OR  many years prior to my arrival and she was the one responsible for giving me a weekend option position when I had my son, allowing me to work Saturday and Sunday nights and therefore I was home Monday - Friday to care for Jim.  And for that I will always be grateful. She was fun and happy and when she led a meeting that she  felt was getting out of hand she had a hallmark saying.  She would open up her arms and pull her hands toward her chest and repeat, "Come on people. Come on back to me." It worked every time. I even do that now in meetings and think of her each time!

    The second ya-ya was the Director of the Recovery Room, known as the PACU to us. She is small and feisty like my mother and I often told her she looked like my mom as well. She was the one if there was some disaster brewing in the hospital, all you needed to do was page her and add "911" to the call-back message and she came to the rescue. When we would all drive together somewhere, she was the one screaming for us to slow down when anyone else was driving and if she was driving, she was a big believer in no left turns (she made that concept popular before UPS did!)

    The third director was tall, thin and impeccably dressed in Talbots, head to toe. She had the unfortunate job of being at the hospital at 5:00am or before as she was the director of  the pre-operative department. (Someone had to get everyone ready prior to a 7:30am OR start, right? Well, her team did it.) By the time I arrived to work some days, she had already worked a half day and was ready for lunch! This ya-ya had a quiet disposition but if any surgeon tried to ruffle her feathers, she could take him down in an instant. Some surgeons went months trying to ignore her in the department. She considered that a victory!

    The last ya-ya was my partner. While I was the clinical specialist in the OR, she was the specialist in the pre-operative and post-operative phases of surgery. Together we educated, oriented, taught courses, updated standards, wiped the tears of many an orientee and  we were the support team that backed up the three directors mentioned above. I call her "Country Mouse" and she calls me "City Mouse." Do you remember that children's story? Well, to this day she will email me or text me and start with: "Mouse".......

    Five of us. People told us in the hospital that we ran in a pack - five long, white lab coats flapping in the wind as we would put out one fire here, another fire there.

    At lunch time, one of the ya-ya's always paged the other four and we would meet in someone's office and off we would go to the cafeteria together. I guess we did run in a pack, didn't we? We weathered marriages, divorces, children, grandchildren, illnesses, diseases. As the world in that large five hospital system changed and swirled around us, we were "tighter than ticks" as they say down south.

    I was the one who broke up the group when I left and moved to Connecticut. When I then moved to Virginia, and was diagnosed so quickly, they packed up a car and drove to spend the weekend with me. We had a ball - laughing and reminiscing. One of the ya-ya's bought a pair of stilettos while there (she was always sporting 4" heels) and I bought a mink stole at a vintage shop. That night at dinner I put on the heels and the mink and sat on my back porch with them while we had cocktails. Nothing was too dumb to do around those women. We had been through personal and professional hardships and there were  no fronts to keep up.

    God is funny. The new person who took my position so reminded me of myself 20 years prior, it was amazing. Passionate about the OR, long ponytail swinging when she walked, even staff in the OR told her, "You sure do remind me of Sherri." She says it pleases her. It certainly pleases me.</p>

    <h2>One Out of Eight Will Get Breast Cancer: What I Bet You Didn't Know</h2>

    <p>Again I quote from Dr. Susan Love's website on the explanation of the "one in eight" statistic that is quoted often and everywhere. See if it doesn't make you think differently after reading this:


    Dr. Love states:

    "The one-in-eight statistic doesn't accurately reflect the average woman's breast cancer risk. Age is the most important risk factor for breast cancer. That means the older a woman is, the greater her risk of developing the disease. Statistics from the US National Cancer Institute show that a woman's chance of being diagnosed with breast cancer by age is:

    <div id="navcontainer" class="carrot2">

    <ul id="navlist2">

    	<li><span class="expandTextL">From age 30 to age 39:     0.43 percent      (often expressed as  1 in 233)</span></li>

    	<li><span class="expandTextL">From age 40 to age 49:     1.45 percent       (often expressed as  1 in 69) </span></li>

    	<li><span class="expandTextL">From age 50 to age 59:     2.38 percent      (often expressed as  1 in 42)</span></li>

    	<li><span class="expandTextL">From age 60 to age 69:      3.45 percent      (often expressed as  1 in 29)</span></li>

    	<li><span class="expandTextL"><strong>Ever</strong> . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .<strong>1</strong> <strong>in</strong> <strong>8</strong> (emphasis mine)</span></li>

    </ul>

    </div>

    <strong><span class="main"><em>Ever</em>  is lifetime risk. This means a woman has a one-in-eight chance of getting breast cancer after the age of 70 </span></strong><span class="main">(emphasis mine).</span>

    These probabilities are averages for the whole population. An individual woman’s breast cancer risk may be higher or lower, depending on a number of factors, including her family history, reproductive history, race/ethnicity, and other factors that are not yet fully understood. "

  <h2>Boston Globe: Expand conversation to include metastatic breast cancer</h2>

  <p>Anne Morris who is the chief executive officer of Susan G. Komen Massachusetts wrote a powerful article in the <em>Boston Globe</em> today of which I have taken an excerpt. Some days I have hope that metastatic breast disease will get the coverage it needs. Today is one of those days.

  <blockquote><!-- inside story_update.jpt --><!-- end article-text --><!-- Story tools --><!-- position:Bottom --><!-- uuid: aff92c60-5881-11e4-8cbb-6f10485da42a -->According to a recent survey, it’s clear that societal awareness of metastatic breast cancer shows a lack of understanding, and highlights the need to move beyond the current conversation. In fact, <strong>63 percent of Bay Staters surveyed know little or nothing about metastatic breast cancer, while 70 percent think advanced breast cancer is curable. Additionally, 47 percent think cancer progresses because the patient either didn’t get the right treatments or didn’t take the right preventative measures </strong>(emphasis mine).

  Given all this, it’s no wonder those living with metastatic breast cancer can feel excluded from the larger dialogue and emotionally unsupported. This lack of understanding on the part of the general public excludes these women, and their stories, from the daily dialogue.

  Women in Massachusetts and from all across the nation are at risk due to this huge communication gap when it comes to metastatic breast cancer. Helping those living with this dreadful disease feel like part of the conversation is an urgent matter.

  Metastatic breast cancer isn’t curable. In fact, the average survival time following a metastatic breast cancer diagnosis is approximately three years, and even lower among certain ethnicities. It remains the second leading cause of cancer deaths among women today.

  According to a study published in the journal The Oncologist, roughly one in three — nearly 30 percent — of women diagnosed with early breast cancer will eventually be diagnosed with metastatic breast cancer.

  Those of us who know someone diagnosed with breast cancer, even if it’s not advanced, need to heed the call to expand our knowledge of the disease and to understand the profound emotional toll that patients go through. These patients have different needs and different struggles than those diagnosed with early stage breast cancer."</blockquote>]</p>

  <h2>Dr. Susan Love's Take on the "October Pink Tsunami"</h2>

  <p>
  I read Dr. Love's blog<a title="Dr. Love's Blog" href="http://blog.dslrf.org/" target="_blank"> http://blog.dslrf.org/</a> today and thought that her words were powerful.  This is just a portion of  the blog:

  <blockquote> In addition, many companies agree that supporting breast cancer research and awareness is good politics and good business. Sometimes these well-meaning efforts, such as the recent pink drilling bits for the cure, can appear misguided, but that does not mean that the people who donated the money had nefarious motives or that the money will not be well spent.

  As we all compete for the public’s attention and dollars, we sometimes forget that this is not a race with just one winner; it is a team sport. There are many ways we can save the lives of women and men with breast cancer, whether it be by helping them get diagnosed and appropriately treated, or by focusing on research into possible causes, be they environmental, lifestyle, or genetic. There is no lack of areas that need money and serious study. For example, we don’t even know the anatomy of the ducts in the breast or exactly how breast cancer starts!

  <strong>When the NFL is wearing pink, it’s pretty clear that, collectively, we have achieved awareness </strong>(emphasis mine). We need all the organizations with their different perspectives to focus on their missions while joining in a collaborative effort to find the cause and ways to prevent breast cancer. Because the end goal, a future without breast cancer, is one we all can agree on."</blockquote>]</p>

  <h2>Dancing to Different Music</h2>

  <p>Over the weekend I read an article in <em>USA Today <a title="With fewer choices left, cancer patient turns to mom" href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/10/24/breast-cancer-patient-turns-to-mom-as-days-wane/17843777/" target="_blank">With fewer choices left, cancer patient turns to mom</a></em><a title="With fewer choices left, cancer patient turns to mom" href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/10/24/breast-cancer-patient-turns-to-mom-as-days-wane/17843777/" target="_blank"> </a>and realized it was about the young woman I highlighted a couple of posts ago - the  video post of the beautiful young woman who had gone to Paris and been professionally photographed. In that video, she was also interviewed and discussed her diagnosis of Stage IV breast cancer. This video is about a year old. The article I read showed a very different person. The woman in the article, the same woman in the pink chiffon dress in the video, is in a very different place now. There were few things I noticed:

  <ul>

  	<li>Jill told her oncologist that she was losing strength and did not want to continue her chemo. Her oncologist "listened" but then suggested that there were other chemo regimes that they could try.</li>

  	<li>Jill listened and then had to say to her oncologist, "What if I said I'm just done with chemo altogether?"</li>

  	<li>Jill and her husband are not in agreement with her desire to stop treatment. She says in the article, it is their only source of "contention" as she calls it.</li>

  	<li>I was surprised when she said in this article that, "it finally hit me that I am going to die of cancer..."</li>

  	<li>Her mother lives out of town but is planning to move in with Jill at the end. Her mother stated she did not want to move too soon so as not to alarm Jill in thinking that she has "lost all hope."</li>

  </ul>

  In reading the article, it made me feel sad. As close as Jill, her husband and her mother are, when each of them speaks, everyone is hearing something different. And when you add her oncologist into the mix, it becomes four very caring people, all on a different page.  They seem to be dancing around the obvious and I understand it. I really do.</p>

  <h2>My Periwinkle Palace</h2>

  <p></a>



  &nbsp;



  We bought our beach house on the outer banks of NC two years ago and for some unknown reason, I named it my "periwinkle palace." It is periwinkle colored but it is not a palace, except to me. Our refuge. We try and get there about once a month with an extended stay in the summer and at Christmas. The outer banks as most of you know is abbreviated as OBX. And for some, Christmas is abbreviated XMAS. Am I the only one who thinks this would be a neat license plate:  <strong>OBXMAS</strong>. No one in my family, or extended family (and you know who you are) thinks it's very clever. Well, I do.  I am hoping I get this license plate for Xmas but I doubt I will. At any rate, by the time the tiny yellow butterflies start to flutter on the beach, it is September and a reminder that we will get "our" beach back soon. We always say to ourselves, "go home and put the kids back in school...give us back our beach!" Snobby I know but really that's how the locals feel and we count ourselves as such. Heck, we get the "local's rate" on food depending on the restaurant and the day of the week. Bet you didn't know there was such a thing!

  I have a favorite bartender, yes I know, I really have many but this one is my most favorite because he and I have had many a serious talk while I have  had dinner and/or a drink at his bar. When I am alone during the week down there, I jump in my golf cart (!) and drive across the street to eat with him - my buddy. He calls our beach area, "the island of misfits" which is true and adorable. All you have to do is go and visit in November or December and take a look around. The folks look interesting and disinterested all at the same time. I love to go in the winter where we can all sit at the bar and the tables behind us are all empty! "Just us locals," I like to think. It's cold and windy and dark and the drinks flow freely. No kids, no sunburns, everything is slow and wonderful there that time of year.

  I am especially looking forward to Christmas this year. The week before Christmas my sister/brother-in-law are coming with 2,3,4 nieces/nephews (the number is fluid). And  my parents will come Christmas day bearing food from their Christmas Eve soirée. (My nieces and nephews all believe that "Mama Jane's" potato salad rocks.) December 26, the (step) kids come - I hate that word 'step' but anyway....... and it will be a house packed with movies, laughter, card games (my niece is a wicked game player - if she wants to challenge you to a game - any game -  run away and say no!)

  So much fun. I am so blessed. And I don't take a minute of it for granted.</p>

  <h2>METAvivor: Listen to What These Wise Women Have to Say</h2>

  <p>From the METAvivor website:  METAvivor is dedicated to the specific fight of women and men living with stage 4 metastatic breast cancer. At the time of METAvivor’s founding, no organization was dedicated to funding research for the disease and no patient groups were speaking out about the dearth of stage 4 cancer research.  While more and more people have taken up the cry for more stage IV research, METAvivor remains the sole US organization dedicated to awarding annual stage IV breast cancer research.

  <h2>Up in the Trees</h2>

  <p>They are forecasting snow on Saturday. No, I am not kidding. Not much, but enough to keep me inside, tucked away in my treetop apartment on the third floor. (If you are ever in town, we live above the Bass Outlet and the local yarn shop.) In my little corner of the family room, I am surrounded by large floor to ceiling windows - four of them that make up our back wall. Brick between them, we look out on large trees that I haven't been able to identify - thin fernlike leaves which turn yellow very late in the summer (like the end of August, first of September) and then flutter and twirl as the wind comes through the two mountain tiers between which we live. From my window now as I type, I can see the Chemung river (really very shallow but lovely and meandering. When I go for treatment tomorrow, it rides along beside me all the way to hospital some 45 miles away.)

And I can see the high school. It's all so sweet. In the morning, the fog lays heavily in town and I can often hear the band practicing and wonder how they can practice their marching if they can't see their hands in front of their faces. But since I am warm and cozy in my bed at that hour (!) I just roll over and wish them luck.

We are so fortunate to have a roof top terrace  that for a very brief period of time in the spring and summer, I can go out and read and tend my very small garden. Our cats, most folks know these two guys, Simon and Johnny, will push their overweight selves out there and spend it lolling about alongside me. The three of us don't get much done anymore.

By the end of the day we have worked our way over to wait by the door for "the one who does not want to be mentioned in this blog" to get home from work, so we can have some fun. It has taken me a long time to feel ok about not getting a whole lot done on any given day. But I am ok with it. I don't fight it. I just go along with it. I'm like a cat in a shoebox - perfectly at peace watching the world go by.</p>

  <h2>One Last Word to End Pink October Month</h2>

    <p>Two things as we finally end this month of pink. If you haven't viewed the metavivor video from a couple of days ago, would you do it for me as a favor? It is such an important topic. And if you can, would you pass the video on to your friends and family? There is so much misinformation out there and this short video to me sums it up so nicely.

Secondly, the quote below was at the end of one of my blogs. But it is probably the second most important thing I posted in the month of October following the video from above. So I am going to use it one more time.

“We did nothing wrong. Our medical team did nothing wrong. Metastatic breast cancer happens...at any time...regardless of your age, whether you did chemo[therapy], radiation, had a mastectomy, had a bilateral mastectomy, ate well, took vitamins, exercised regularly, prayed, had positive thoughts, had negative thoughts, got regular mammograms, did self- exams religiously, had a tiny stage 1 primary tumor, or a stage 0 primary tumor, or a stage 3 primary tumor, or never even had primary breast cancer. <strong>It doesn’t matter</strong>.” —MBCN website (emphasis mine).</p>

  <h2>An Important Person I Missed When Talking About The OBXmas</h2>

  <p>So, it dawned on me in my eagerness to talk about OBXMAS, I neglected to mention my sister who has made her way out to the edges of NC from Winston-Salem (5 1/2 hours away) for the past couple of years to celebrate with us. Note: Don't forget about your blood relatives! She is far too kind to text me and say, "Hey, what gives?" She knows my mind is a sieve now and doesn't give me a hard time.  We started this new tradition when we bought the OBX house and my mother moved to Raleigh from W-S. Though sometimes tough, traditions do  change throughout time; I didn't think I would manage to live life without my grandmother's dressing at Thanksgiving but somehow I've managed (though I still miss it and hope she has a big dish of it for me in heaven when I see her).
My mother hosted Christmas for many, many years but life has changed and we now have Christmas at the beach. The first year, I had been given a golf cart by the one who does not want to be mentioned because although we live very near the ocean, it is still far enough walk for me that once I get to the water, I am too tired to walk the beach. So, last year, it was a cold but sunny Christmas day and my sister and I thought we would take a ride on the cart and then walk the beach. We bundled ourselves up, made Manhattans, put one in our mother's hand (she is fun watch when she drinks these on a rare occasion) placed her in the cart and off we went. Actually we were chauffeured to the beach (by the unmentionable one)  and the three of us in the back of the cart were jiggled, wiggled and sloshed to the beach.  He likes to drive 'fast' in the cart and sling his passengers around. If you get in the golf cart, put a lid on your drink and hang on.  You have been warned.  Until two years ago, I couldn't have imagined an oceanic holiday; now I can't imagine not having one.

My sister is a good cook and extremely handy. When she arrives, she is bearing all kinds of good things to eat - especially the 'top of the stove' cookies that we ate as kids until we made ourselves sick. Did you make them when you were young? In our house, we always had the ingredients around - even if we didn't have other things to eat (cocoa, milk, butter, oatmeal, peanut butter and sugar). The first time my husband ate them, he went crazy. He prays for them now every year. She does not disappoint. She also quietly goes around my house, tightening loose things, hammering loose boards - she notices things I do not because she is an architectural restorer by trade. Every time she leaves, my kitchen is stocked with snacks and the house is in better shape.
For the past two years, it has been my husband, me, my sister and parents - a smaller gathering than we have ever had but it has been peaceful. We took our time opening gifts, ate dinner slowly and had a really great time.  I hope my sister will attend the larger Fillipo gathering this Christmas. It will be a different day for sure but if the weather is good, we will still make our way to the water, Manhattans in hand.</p>

  <h2>TSA Adventure</h2>

  <p>I had an adventure yesterday. You see, since my beloved and I still travel fairly often, I get irritated when I see him scoot through the "TSA-pre check" line while I stand back in the back with the folks who have never been on an airplane before or the woman who is trying to carry on a gallon of milk. And while he is through security, I am still standing there ten people back from the conveyor and it makes me crazy. Well, I shouldn't use that word. In a minute, I will tell you why.

For those who avoid planes, by being pre-checked it means you can leave your sweater and coat on, your shoes on and you don't have to take out your laptop nor your little teeny tiny fluids from your bag. In larger airports, they have a separate line and you can jet right through. It can often make a world of difference in flying...

So if you look on the TSA-pre check website, you will find locations where you can go and if you can spare $85 and have a valid passport, they can grill you like you are being charged with a crime and then tell you in 21 days, you will become what is called a 'known traveler' and then you too can scoot through the line with all your clothes on.  So the closest site is in Rochester, NY, 90 miles away which is a good distance except it is a beautiful, bucolic drive through the mountains. So off I went.

I gave myself ample time because twice now I have been to Rochester and have lost GPS capability and gotten lost once I reached the city. So I wanted to make sure that I did not waste  a trip for nothing thinking that TSA folks probably aren't the most flexible people in the world. When I arrived, I thought I was late to a party. There were a dozen people already waiting (I was smart enough to have gotten an appointment but I didn't feel like it would make much difference looking at this crowd.)  I waited a half hour while all these rough and tumble men in the waiting room talked about their war stories in traveling, each one trying to out do the other. I  thought about jumping into the fray and blowing them all away with my travel stories but I demurred.

When it was my turn, I walked into an office where the clerk had a computer, I had a monitor and off we went. I had to verify and re-verify my identify, all the names I had ever used. I had to type in my social security number twice (she is sitting there with all this information - I think it was just a test to make sure I knew everything??) Then I was fingerprinted - all ten of them. And finally I had to read the monitor and affirm what I had already done prior to my arrival. Oh yes, I had already completed the pre-check form at home and it had been emailed to them. I had to verify that I had not been convicted of a crime etc. etc and then I had to confirm that I was not mentally insane. I sat there for a moment, thinking, "Well, sometimes I feel like I am losing my mind." But trust me when I tell you she wasn't the type that wanted to hear about anyone's cancer saga, so I looked her straight in the eye and said, "I am not insane."

I was then shown on the screen one last statement and I had to verify it with signature. It stated something to the effect, "If after 48 hours of leaving this office, you find yourself mentally insane, you must notify this office."  I thought, "You know  - you would be the first person I would call. Forget my husband, my mother, my oncologist, darn it all - I will call you, TSA lady. Can I have your direct dial number?"</p>

  <h2>Marcia Strassman</h2>

  <p></a>
  &nbsp;

  Do you remember the actress Marcia Strassman? If the name is not familiar to you, if you were watching TV in the '70s like I was, she played the wife on <em>Welcome Back Kotter</em>. She was also in the movie <em>Honey I Shrunk the Kids. </em>(I would have uploaded a younger photo of her but they were too expensive!)

  Katherine O'Brien is a blogger who writes about having cancer as well. She posted a recent blog and I wanted to show you a quote from it.  I know I am preaching to the choir as they say, but it again delivers that most important message:

  <blockquote>Although Strassman freely acknowledged her Stage IV diagnosis, not a single news report used the phrases “Stage IV” or “metastatic” breast cancer. I hope I don’t sound petty–to her grieving friends and family I am sure this is a small point and one that unfortunately does nothing to alleviate their loss. But it is so important....saying that Marcia Strassman died of breast cancer <strong>after living with it for seven years somehow implies she died because she let her guard down and WHAM! breast cancer got her....this is not what happened. When someone dies from breast cancer, they died because the cancer spread beyond the breast and eventually overwhelmed the body </strong>(emphasis mine).</blockquote>

  Unusual for breast cancer patients, she was diagnosed at Stage IV from the beginning when it was found in her bones. As Katherine O'Brien said in her blog, if there is such a thing as a metastatic breast cancer continuum, she was on the "good" end with it only in her bones for such a long time.  Marcia Strassman was 66.

  <h2>I Don't Want to Leave A Mess</h2>

  <p></a>
  &nbsp;
  Remember when I told you I had seen a therapist after I couldn't quit crying when a co-worker died at work? (See the post <em>Homework</em> if not). I had forgotten this conversation with the therapist until I went into our spare bedroom just now and it reminded me... After I had gotten the co-worker story out, I was in the midst of talking to the therapist  about all sorts of things when I mentioned to her off-handedly that I had been cleaning out the drawers in our guest bathroom. "You know what I mean. All those old lipsticks and bottles of half-used lotion." She smiled at me quizzically. "I mean, I don't want to die and leave behind a mess." I was serious and she giggled. "Do you hear yourself? You are dying of cancer and you are worried about the mess someone will be left with after you are gone?"

  "Yes," I laughed back. "I am very concerned what people will think who might venture into my drawers and closets. I don't want to leave a bad impression."

  One of my friends thinks I am a very neat and organized person. She will be the one trying to help out and she will look up and say, "She fooled us all. She's just a dirty, little packrat." Somebody else will pull out a sweater or something off a hangar and will say, " Well, getting on the show  <em>What not to Wear</em> should have been on her bucket list instead of going snowmobiling."

  I can't let that happen. So in the midst of doing a little writing, fixing dinner at night, I clean out a drawer here, throw away something there - after all, I want to leave a good impression.

  <h2>Déjà Vu All Over Again</h2>

  <p>I knew this day would come but had not been looking forward to it. You see, I have been working per diem for Surgical Services updating their patient education materials for several months now. They  allow me to work from home as I can, when I can and for that I will be forever grateful. Some days I actually rack up 3 or 4  hours! That's a big day - it doesn't happen often. I am not sure how many education sheets I have to update but let's guess maybe 75-100. In my former life I was a general surgery operating room nurse. In large ORs you typically specialize and I loved doing 'big belly cases' as we call them - bowel resections, gall bladders back in the day when they were big surgeries not the little tiny outpatient surgery that it is now....but I digress. I was asked if I would start with general surgery and work my way through the other specialties like vascular, OBGYN, etc. Of course.

My first job was to alphabetize the cases so I could keep better track of what I was doing so I have been slogging through the "A's" abscesses (!), appendectomies, through the "H's" like hemorrhoidectomy. Do you now see how much fun I have sitting here alone in my apartment trying to write on the 6th grade level (which is what is needed when writing for the public, did you know?) trying to explain what will happen when you finally have your hemorrhoids taken care of?!<a

Today I got to the "M's" -  I have been dreading this like you wouldn't believe. Today I have to update the  "mastectomy" patient education sheet.  I'd rather do anything than this. I remember in Virginia when I was talking to my general surgeon as we discussed my surgical options. He at that point did not know I had scrubbed in on dozens of mastectomies, double mastectomies, and breast biopsies. I had augmented them, reduced them and turned them every way but inside-out.  I could tell he was trying to gingerly dance around what I already knew was getting ready to happen in a few weeks. And  I finally said, " I worked as an operating room nurse in general surgery for many years." The look on his face immediately changed and he said, "Oh.........................you know then................" Yes I am afraid I do.

Well, I have postponed this inevitable patient education form as long as I can. So I will stop this blogging and start the update. It feels like deja vu all over again......................</p>

  <h2>Talbots Love Affair: It Had to End</h2>

  <p>&nbsp;
  Well, over the weekend I continued to clean up and clean out, if you know what I mean. I had to laugh at some of the emails and texts I got after that post about not leaving a mess. I don't know why it really struck a chord. My own aunt texted me and called me "weird" which tickled me  because that is about the dirtiest word I think she has ever uttered! No, not the sidekick aunt I wrote about but my older, more reserved aunt (who I still get a kick out of) and who I know was just teasing me.

  OK: true confession. I love Talbots, always have, always will. I love that red door just about as much as I love the red doors on Episcopal churches. For all of my professional life, I could walk in Talbots, choose clothes off the rack, put them on and they would  fit like a glove. When we lived in Connecticut, we actually lived near a Talbots outlet!!! Oh, the bargains I bought. Loved, loved, loved it. At the time and up until November 2012, I could justify a non-sale item at Talbots because I worked in an environment that required that I dress the part - especially in Connecticut. Those women dressed to take out the trash.

  Last spring, when I was not working, I knew it was time to 'let go'  both figuratively and literally. And for all the many ways I have been able to free and release myself with  this cancer diagnosis, giving away my professional clothes was the one thing I could not do. I made my better half use those vacuum sucking bags and I had a virtual Talbots store vacuum packed in my closet last year. All spring and summer, I would look at that tower of clothing and this weekend, when I got caught in a brief snow shower wearing a thin long sleeved shirt, I knew it was time to release those clothes from their vacuumed state, keep a few and release the rest to those who have a job and could really use some nice clothes.

  The one thing that finally allowed me to take the plunge is that my younger stepdaughter, the one I nicknamed "Cupcake" several years ago, is getting ready to graduate from Temple University in the spring and is headed toward a DPT degree (cupcake, did I abbreviate it correctly?) The kids have been kidding me for months as I can't get it out - a Doctorate of Physical Therapy...DPT. It just sounds like an immunization to me but anyway).....she is in need of some work clothes, interviewing clothes and we talked about me giving her some. That was my catalyst this weekend. I began by telling myself I was setting aside things for Cupcake. And then before I knew it, I was able to acknowledge that a.) I was no longer working outside the apartment, b.)I couldn't fit in most of the pants anyway, thank you very much and c.) she needed some of my blazers.

  I have finally done it. I have winnowed my clothes, thrown away things that might embarrass me posthumously and arranged everything by color. Yes, that helps me seeing things in their rainbow glory. So, if you came into my closet now, I would be proud....but the drawers, now that's another matter altogether.......</p>

  <h2>Naked Both Coming and Going</h2>

  <p>
  &nbsp;
  Let me tell you how funny I think God can be. I really mean it. So my routine in the mornings is that I stumble to the coffee and then I sit down for a few minutes. I watch a little bit of news and then see if there are any emails. Then I make my way over to our computer (all of this is in one large room). I re-read the blog that I am going to post and then I hit the submit button. I sit back down on the couch with another cup of coffee and have my devotional. All of this can transpire from 30 minutes to three hours. Don't think I am up scurrying around like a squirrel hiding nuts. That would be my golden girls if you read that post. I am one slow woman in the morning - both pre and post cancer. Just so you know...........

  Yesterday after I posted the Talbots blog, I began reading my devotional. Several times a month I add something that I found called "scripture typer" which is just an electronic  way to actually memorize scripture. You choose what verses you want to commit to memory and then every month, it reminds you it's time to see if they have remained in your long term memory (oh my). Of the ones that I needed to review, today up popped this one: "Naked you came into this world and naked you shall leave. Blessed be the name of the Lord." I almost wet my pants and I know most people don't think the book of Job as being terribly funny but I thought God was saying, "Indeed young lady. You will not be needing your tower of Talbots clothing where you are going. Now, go and giveth those clothes away."</p>

  <h2>Elizabeth Edwards</h2>

  <p>I have a file folder on my computer where I keep articles that have impacted me and today I began thinking about an article written by Gale Suilk entitled <em>Re-learning the lessons of Elizabeth Edwards'</em> <em>death</em>. <a title="Elizabeth Edwards" href="http://blog.oup.com/2011/03/edwards-cancer/" target="_blank">http://blog.oup.com/2011/03/edwards-cancer/</a>  It is coming upon the 4th year of her death. I don't know about you but it doesn't seem possible to me. If you will recall, she was diagnosed with metastatic breast cancer while her husband John Edwards was running for president. She kept it quiet for the sake of his campaign and then announced it publically afterward.  There were many in the breast cancer world that thought Edwards would bring forth more conversation, more heft, if you will to the world of Stage IV cancer. But you know what happened? In my opinion, Elizabeth Edwards' voice was drowned out by the medical world.  After Edwards' announcement, her physician at the NC Breast Center went on national television and said that many women with Stage IV breast cancer "do well for many years."

  But as Dr. Susan Love (who I have quoted often and who I believe has a sympathetic but realistic philosophy) wrote soon afterward, "the average survival of women with metastatic breast cancer from the time of first appearance of the metastasis is between 2 and 3 1/2 years.  It hasn't moved that much over the years."

  <blockquote><span style="color: #000000;">Gail Suilk also wrote in her article something that resonates so deeply with me: I want to have hope for my friends and family members who are dealing with aggressive and late stage cancers. I even wish for miracles. But hope for a society wrestling with cancer wrests upon the clear acknowledgement that the only true indicator of medical progress overall would be a significant reduction in the number of deaths and vast improvements in the quality of life... currently she says the only way to survive Stage IV cancer is to die from something else.</span></blockquote>

  "A glass that is half full is also a glass that is  half empty", she states. For some of you that will irritate or you might think, "you need to stay positive."  Well, I like the raw frankness of her words. I will tell you the hardest thing for me to do when I am out in public, even when I am having treatment at the Cancer Center, is to be told to look on the bright side, that there could be a miracle, to stay positive, or be told of someone who lived 25 years with something that I don't even have! I do get worn out trying to convince friends and family that it is as bad as it sounds. I admire Elizabeth Edwards for coming forward and announcing that the disease was back and that it was terminal. You do not see 'celebrity' patients, as she was known, use such frank terms.

  <h2>Today is World Kindness Day</h2>

  <p>
  At the risk of sounding schmaltzy or cheesy this morning, I was in the middles of my routine (you know, the coffee, the news, the waking up) when I scanned <em>US Today</em> and the title of an article caught my eye, "Kid drops out of college to devote life to kindness." <a title="Acts of Kindness" href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2014/11/12/inspiration-nation-ark-project-now/18939687/" target="_blank">http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2014/11/12/inspiration-nation-ark-project-now/18939687/</a>  A young man being  interviewed said he had finished his exams and was watching a movie and at the end of the film, wise Morgan Freeman asks, Do you want to know how to change the world?  One act of random kindness at a time." Sometimes I feel it is an overused phrase but it doesn't mean that I believe the concept is overused.  So, today is world kindness day.

  For those who wish they could do something, maybe everyday instead of one day a year, there is a website that lists dozens of ways both large and small that depending upon your time, skill level and resources you will find something that might spark you into action. <a title="Random Acts of Kindness Ideas" href="http://www.randomactsofkindness.org/kindness-ideas" target="_blank">http://www.randomactsofkindness.org/kindness-ideas.</a> You can filter by cost, by category (environment, animals etc.)

  I confess that sometimes I feel quite on the outside of life. Most of the time as I have written, I am ok with it. Sometimes, I am not. Like last night at  a work function, as I looked around at my former colleagues, most of whom I also consider friends, I got so sentimental as I haven't seen them all together in long, long time. You know how these functions go. Part of the time the talk is social and part of the time it is work. I could keep up with the social but again, the work part, I only knew bits and pieces of the topics and by the time I was saying good-bye and good night, I was a tearful woman.

  After a good cry in the shower when I got home and a little unwinding I went to bed and slept like that proverbial baby. So maybe what I am really getting to is that seeing that article reminded me that  there are dozens of ways I can choose to participate in the world and it is up to me to be creative and find the ways. I just need to wipe my nose and get on with it.</p>

  <h2>Breast Cancer 101:Part 1</h2>

  <p>I was reading another blog recently and this woman was astounded when she went to a support group and she was the only one in the group who knew anything about her cancer. This made me think that for some of you, it might be helpful to explain a few terms you might read about, hear from friends or from your own doctor.

<ul>

<li>There are several types of breast cancer but the two you will most likely read about  is either ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) which means it is sitting inside the milk duct and <strong>has not invaded</strong> any other tissue. Invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC)  means the nasty bugger has invaded the surrounding tissue.  It has worked its way outside of the duct.</li>

</ul>

<ul>

<li>Once the cancer has been determined IDC or DCIS, it is "staged."   This assists doctors (along with other things) in determining treatment options.

<ul>

<li>Stage 0-1 means the tumor cells have been confined to a limited area</li>

<li>Stage 2A and 2B means that the tumor is still growing but has moved its way to the lymph nodes.  A versus B denotes the size of the tumor and whether or not it has invaded the lymph nodes. For more in depth reading on this, click on <a title="Stage 2 A and B" href="http://www.nationalbreastcancer.org/breast-cancer-stage-2" target="_blank">http://www.nationalbreastcancer.org/breast-cancer-stage-2</a></li>

<li>Stage 3A, 3B, or 3C means the tumor has extended  beyond the immediate region of the tumor itself and may have invaded nearby lymph nodes and muscles, but has not spread to distant organs.  For more information, <a title="Stage 3 A B C" href="http://www.nationalbreastcancer.org/breast-cancer-stage-3" target="_blank">http://www.nationalbreastcancer.org/breast-cancer-stage-3</a></li>

<li>Stage 4 means the tumor has spread to distant organs. The most common organs for breast cancer to spread to are the lungs, liver, bone, and brain.</li>

</ul>

</li>

</ul>

Next week, I will add more information but don't you think this is enough for one day? So, for me I had bilateral (both) IDC breast cancer meaning both tumors had begun to spread into the surrounding breast tissue. I was staged at the time as  2A, one with spread to a node, the other with no spread.  Knowing where I ended up, I bet you are surprised aren't you?</p>

  <h2>Arbitrary Weekend Updates</h2>

  <p>I should probably make this a weekly thing but at least for today I will update you on things that really don't mean a hoot as they say down south:

<ul>

<li>My aunt called to inform me that she called me a "mess" not "weird"  for writing about cleaning out my closets. That term is also very southern as I found out at Yale one day when I was talking about my son. I noticed a discomfort in the room afterward and had to backtrack until I realized that culturally they had no idea that I meant it as an endearment. The room was much kinder once we got that straight. So, yes, my aunt was being endearing and not judgmental!</li>

<li>To date, I have not lost my mind and my TSA known traveler number did arrive. Now, if I can only keep my mind intact...</li>

<li>I got a text from a friend and former colleague who thought my use of the varying phrase, "he who does not want to be mentioned" was so clever and he began to wax on about Harry Potter. Well, having never read Harry Potter, I thought he had gone off the deep end until we realized I had used that phrase innocently. He then said he was finally glad to be able to teach me something about popular culture since he had never heard of <em>Welcome Back Kotter</em>. OUCH!</li>

<li>A friend from that cocktail party this week leaned over and asked me if I had any clothes left in my closet. I think she was serious! Yes, I have more than I need and still need to cull some out.</li>

<li>My reserved aunt was fretting and finally asked me if I had least kept one Talbots outfit... for .....for.....for... I said, "My funeral?"  Yes, that's what she meant but couldn't get it out. I burst out laughing. The answer is, no.</li>

<li>My sidekick aunt thought I had made up the word "schmaltzy" in the blog about world kindness day. But she had either googled it or asked someone before she emailed me! And said, "That's a real word!" (Bless her heart. Not her fault. She has never lived nor walked amongst the northerners!)</li>

</ul></p>

  <h2>Breast Cancer 101: Part 2</h2>

  <p><ul>

  	<li>When a breast tumor is found, additional lab studies are performed on it which will guide your physicians in the type of treatment you would benefit best from. The tumor will be tested for what's called hormone receptors. The two that you need to know are estrogen and progesterone. .  If the tumor is estrogen positive, <strong>ER+</strong> that means that the tumor uses estrogen to fuel its cell growth. Same for progesterone. If positive, <strong>PR+</strong> the tumor responds to this hormone in the body.  Typical response rates to hormone therapy are as follows:</li>

  </ul>

  <ul>

  	<li>ER+ and PR+: 75-80%</li>

  	<li>ER+ and PR-: 40-50%</li>

  	<li>ER- and PR+: 25-30%</li>

  	<li>ER- and PR- : 10% or less</li>

  </ul>

  <p style="padding-left: 30px;">2.  The third important testing that is done on the tumor is determining if there is  "overexpression" meaning too much of <strong>Her2, </strong>(human epidermal growth factor receptor 2) a specific kind of protein. If positive,<strong> "Her2-positive"</strong> it means the body is  making too much protein and the tumor is using it for fuel as well. This type of cancer often grows faster, spreads to other areas more readily, and has a higher likelihood of recurring versus <strong>Her2-negative</strong> breast cancer.  25% of breast cancer patients are + for this protein.</p>

  If a woman is negative for all three, you will often see the term "<strong>triple negative</strong>" used and unfortunately, hormonal therapies for these women don't work. Triple negative breast cancer occurs in about 10-20% of diagnosed breast cancers and is more likely to affect younger people, African Americans, and Hispanics.  Triple negative breast cancer can be more aggressive and difficult to treat.  Also, the cancer is more likely to spread and recur.

  If you desire more information, I used  this website as my resource and it is quite thorough : <a title="National Breast Cancer Organization" href="http://www.nationalbreastcancer.org/about-breast-cancer" target="_blank">http://www.nationalbreastcancer.org/about-breast-cancer</a>.]]></p>

  <h2>Betty Ford</h2>

  <p>
    Recently, I was reading in <em>RealSimple</em> magazine and noted that when Betty Ford was diagnosed with breast cancer in 1974, back in the days when you didn't say the phrase "breast cancer" out loud, she received 60,000 letters from people across the US. In a Newsweek magazine article after her diagnosis in 1974, she was credited with tearing down the barriers of this hush-hush diagnosis and bringing it out into the open. She allowed the media into her hospital room (she's better than me - I would have kept them waaay out) but I get the sense she was just that kind of trailblazer. And her life continued to exemplify that. If you will recall, she acknowledged an addiction to pills and alcohol and head held high several years later, entered a rehabilitation facility to deal with her addiction.

    Clearly she did not end up having metastatic disease but I think we can all be appreciative of her ability to push this nation along and getting the disease out in the forefront. I am willing to give her the credit (but not Campbell's soup or the NFL) for  bringing breast cancer awareness to the country.

    <h2>Healthcare Tug-O-War</h2>

    <p>
      I need to offer up a disclaimer before I start today: I love my healthcare providers. I really do. From my oncologist, to my nurse practitioner, to my infusion nurses, they have cared for me and my beloved so, so well over the past two years. But sometimes a woman's gottta whine...............



  So, I just got back from treatment. You know, the every third week date I have 45 miles east of Corning?  And I am feeling caught somewhere between savvy nurse, worn out patient, and petulant child. Not a good place to be, right?! Let me explain. Two years ago I had three symptoms that ruled my world without ceasing: nausea, fatigue and let's just say<em> GI issues</em> to put it in a nice southern term. That's what led my oncologist to order scans, which showed spread to the liver and the rest is history.....in the past two years, each of those little thorns has been bothering me but a lot like that carnival game whack-a-mole as soon as one would rear its ugly head, the other one would duck....until about a month ago where they all decided to take up residence in my body at the same time. Without ceasing.


  <p style="text-align: left;">That's when my oncologist wanted me to get an upper endoscopy. No, thank you I said politely. And not to be from the south, she was very southern in her backdoor approach to twisting my arm but I stood firm. I have seen those done and I do not care to have one done on me since I know what I think is causing the problem. So she and I did a little healthcare bargaining. If I had a PET scan done and it showed nothing, would I then consider the upper  endo? Yes, I agreed. Well, you know what the scan showed, two lesions in my liver starting to act up. You know that gross commercial about mucus - that green gunky animal looking thing? That's what I think those lesions look like wreaking havoc in my liver but I digress.</p>

  So, today it was my turn to see the nurse practitioner. An incredibly bright, thorough nurse. I like her very much but when she asked me how I was doing, I told her that the three amigos were back and I felt the next PET scan would show increased numbers. (That was the savvy nurse talking.) She then said, "But if you are nauseous and not eating, that could lead to GI troubles which could be making you nauseous....." She was telling me I was putting myself in a vicious cycle and that she wanted me to have the upper endo to see if something else was causing my symptoms. I turned to the one who will not be named and he stayed silent. Then I turned into the weary patient and started crying, "No, I really think it is my liver. I am so tired of this.....two years....every three weeks..." She relented. "OK, but if the next PET scan shows no progress, can we come back to the table with the endo?" I told her yes and then confessed I had stopped taking one of my oral meds when I ran out and as soon as I ran out, my headaches stopped with it. So then she says, "OK. When the PET scan comes back with no progression, will you have the endo <strong>and</strong> start back on the med?" (Here comes the petulant child.)

  "Yes" I said, "But I am telling you like I have told Dr. xxxx, the first hot flash I get (a side effect) I am either throwing myself out the window, or the drugs, or both."

  "Fair enough," she said. She was so poised and so wise and I sat there like a triumphant child after a tantrum. Oh my.</p>

  <h2>BRCA1 &amp; BRCA2: Why Angelina Jolie Makes Me Crazy</h2>

  <p>
    OK. Right off the bat. Angelina Jolie makes me crazy for all kinds of reasons, the least of which is the way she thought she was helping the masses and her family by removing her breasts because of a "faulty gene" as she calls it. I would like to talk a bit about this faulty gene. You can consider this Breast Cancer: Part 3 if you want to.   Do you remember in 2013 when she had prophylactic double mastectomies after she tested positive for the BRCA gene? She also says that she did this because her mother died young (56) from cancer. <a title="Angelina Jolie Op Ed NYT" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/14/opinion/my-medical-choice.html?_r=0" target="_blank">http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/14/opinion/my-medical-choice.html?_r=0</a>

    BRCA1 and BRCA2 are human genes that produce tumor suppressing proteins which helps repair cells to keep a 'balance' if you will in the body. Remember that cancer are cells that have mutated or changed in a bad way and then they replicate out of control and overwhelm an organ, organs or the entire body. If you are tested and are positive for one of these genes, your chances of breast cancer are increased but it doesn't mean that you will automatically get breast cancer.    There are a few things that need clarifying though that her op ed piece and others in the news didn't really mention:</p>

    <ul>

    	<li>As my general surgeon and I discussed in 2010, I wasn't very interested in being tested. He agreed with me and made an interesting remark, "How many BRCAs are there? Does anyone know? And what if you test negative for 1 and 2? Maybe you are positive for BRCA3 which they haven't even discovered yet. What if there are 50 BRCAs? We just don't know."</li>

    	<li>Insurance may or may not pay. Obviously for Jolie, money wasn't an issue. But I would imagine that $3000 out of pocket as she was quoted as saying would be pretty substantial for many people.</li>

    	<li>Even if you are tested and it comes back positive, the testing cannot tell you if you will ever get cancer nor when. Sometimes the test comes back ambiguous. Do you feel better or worse after the tests tells you nothing?</li>

    	<li>If it comes back negative, a woman may breathe a sigh of relief but that does not mean that she won't get cancer. How many out there believe if it's negative, I'm home free? My guess? <strong>A lot!</strong></li>

    	<li>If you test positive, then what do you do? For many, they start getting more mammograms (see previous posts on that topic) or they start wondering if they should do what Angelina Jolie did and have them removed. I like what Dr. Susan Love said about it. She said, "when you have to cut off normal body parts to prevent a disease, that’s really pretty barbaric when you think about it.” Meaning we are so far off from understanding breast cancer and when  sometimes the best thing is to 'amputate'  it means we are just treading water, not swimming toward shore with an answer to this disease.</li>

    	<li>If you do not have one of the risk factors that would make you think about having this test, going ahead and having it done because Angelina did, well guess what? It has been shown to give false-positive test results, meaning it is saying you are at risk but you are really not!</li>

    	<li>According to a follow-up article in the health section after Jolie's article, <a title="Angelina Jolie follow-up NYT" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/15/health/angelina-jolies-disclosure-highlights-a-breast-cancer-dilemma.html?ref=opinion" target="_blank">http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/15/health/angelina-jolies-disclosure-highlights-a-breast-cancer-dilemma.html?ref=opinionMutations </a> BRCA1 and BRCA2 are estimated to cause only 5 percent to 10 percent of breast cancers in white women. No one knows how common or uncommon it is in other races.</li>

    	<li>Surgery, any surgery comes with its own risks. Anesthesia, the safest thing that is done in healthcare, still has its risks. No one should have any surgery done without a thorough knowledge of the risks, benefits and alternatives to the procedure being discussed.</li>

    	<li>Jolie was able to have a nipple sparing procedure. I don't think most women understand when you have cancer and they take your breasts, they do not leave your nipples behind as a souvenir. They are removed as well.</li>

    	<li>In her article, I think she minimized the postoperative phase stating that though she looked like someone from a science fiction movie with her drains, within a few days she was back to living life as normal. Do you know why? <strong>Because she didn't have cancer</strong>. It took me a lot longer and my future was more uncertain than hers. I didn't jump back into life. I jumped into chemo.</li>

    </ul>

    <p>I believe if a woman is genetically tested and finds that she is positive for these genes and she decides to have prophylactic mastectomies, it is within her right to do so. But at the same time I am so saddened and so angered by the women who have chosen this path somehow trying to emulate Angelina Jolie because she is  beautiful and oh so brave.  I have read articles where physicians have been repeatedly unsuccessful talking women out of this 'fad' (my term) thanks to this actress and it breaks my heart. No one should have this done to them, to their bodies, unless they really have no other option. Trust me.

    <h2>Chemo Comes Calling for the Third Time</h2>

    <p>I knew in my gut (no pun intended) that when I had the PET scan in October that the one in December would show further activity and that chemo would be my Christmas gift one more time. I am on some sort of cosmic two year cycle. But my oncologist caught me off guard Friday night when she called to talk to me and to ask me how I felt about going ahead and starting chemo the same week of the scan. I have felt this coming for a couple of months. Look at this odd timeline:</p>

    <ul>
    	<li>I was diagnosed in fall of 2010, started chemo #1 December 2010.</li>
    	<li>Then it spread in fall of 2012 and chemo #2 started in December 2012 (anyone else picking up on this little trend?)</li>
    	<li>And so, I just had my scan in fall of 2014 and guess what? Chemo #3 starts in, you guessed it, December 2014.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Well, at least I am consistent. This is what I know about the last tool in my oncologist's arsenal:

    This chemo called kadcyla (ado-trastuzumab emtansine),  is supposed to be a bear if it is taken on its own. Luckily it is tamed somewhat if you are taking a drug called trastuzumab which I have been on every third week since 2012.  (Aren't I the lucky one?)

    Kadcyla does not cause hair loss. I will be the judge of that since this would be the third time I would be going  bald and vain as it sounds, this was going to be the deciding factor whether I did chemo #3 or not. Wait a minute, do you think my beloved oncologist is lying to me? Nah, I don't think she has ever lied in her life.

    As I have called a few folks over the weekend to tell them, it has occurred to me that many people don't know that there are many kinds of chemo - that chemo is a generic term and is not the cancer drug that everyone takes no matter what the disease. Just a clarification for those that might think that as well. This will be the third different chemo that I will be receiving. As a chemo stops working, in metastatic disease, another chemo is tried. The goal is to keep the cancer at bay as long as possible. Curing it is not. So when one fails, you move on to another one. At some point, the arsenal is used up as in the case of Elizabeth Edwards.

    So, here we go. As they say, "This ain't my first rodeo.</p>

    <h2> A NC Angel</h2>

    <p>Well, I want to tell you about a real-life angel. She is someone I worked with back in North Carolina in the OR. Though we were colleagues and friendly with one another, we weren't buddies. Why, I don't know, looking back. But I remember her being exceedingly smart, very fit and I do believe she served in the Gulf war which seems so long ago now...but let me tell you about this angel in the flesh. I responded to a linkedin post back in the summer (prior to starting my blog) to a man who wrote a post about bucket lists. I commented on the post some of the things that I have blogged about here. And then the most amazing thing happened. This former colleague emailed me and said, "I think everyone should see Billy Joel once in their lifetime. I have two tickets to see him at Madison Square Garden and I would like to send them to you." I was dumbfounded. Not because she is not known for being kind - a great nurse but wholly cow! What an act of kindness! After a couple of emails, I thanked her profusely so guess where we are headed today?

    We are driving to Manhattan today. We will see Billy Joel tonight and on Wednesday, we will shop and marvel at the Christmas lights and shop windows (an annual favorite thing for me to do). Then we will drive Thanksgiving Day further down to Philly to have dinner with my beloved's family.

    Thank you my NC angel for giving me such a wonderful gift.</p>

    <h2>Thanksgiving Angel</h2>

    <p>I had a wonderful Thanksgiving weekend. I hope you did as well. The Billy Joel concert was absolutely fantastic! Midway through, Sting came out and sang and then later for you baby boomers, John Mellencamp came out and sang as well. All in all, a great evening. Our Wednesday was to have been spent getting some of our shopping out of the way but the weather was so horrific (rain&gt;howling wind, turning umbrellas inside-out, sleet&gt;snow&gt; back to rain) we finally ducked in for cover at a Hard Rock Café along with the rest of Manhattan. Beloved and I began to wonder how inexpensively we could see a Broadway matinee. So while we had lunch, I scoured the internet and lo and behold, we found affordable Les Mes tickets and spent the rest of the afternoon at the theater out of the weather. The true definition of serendipitous!

    Thanksgiving Day, we found ourselves literally stuck in Manhattan due to the parade. When I say stuck, I mean literally stuck, with all exits out of the city near where we had parked the car blocked off until 2:00pm that afternoon. When a NYC policeman told us this, I stood there frozen in disbelief. Suddenly I felt claustrophobic. We were going to miss dinner in Philly? Then an 'angel' (see last post) walked up with his wife to retrieve his car from the same garage and when I told him about us all being stuck, he just looked at me and didn't say a word. He paid for his car, the car was brought up from the bowels of the garage and the next thing I knew he told us to follow them. He got in his car, rummaged around for something and then he draped his retired police badge over the rearview mirror. He then turned left (remember that the streets are closed off and it has become a pedestrian walkway) on a one way street and waited for us to pull in behind him. At each intersection cops either lifted barricades or moved their vehicles to let us both by. He waited each time for us to get through the intersections and then before you knew it we were on the very westside of Manhattan He then turned left, we turned right and were on our way to Philly. Angels come in all shapes and sizes!</p>

  <h2>Words to Live By</h2>

  <p>Today is the day that I travel again 45 miles east to the hospital to have a couple of things done in preparation for chemo on Thursday. One of the tests that is done every three months is an echocardiogram which is a fancy way of saying they are taking a 3-D look at my heart. Why? Well, every drug has side effects. And some side effects are simply annoying, like for instance the drug that I have been on for two years has a side effect of a constant runny nose - I kid you not. 24 hours a day, seven days a week. But unless you drive yourself crazy with that one, it won't kill you. And since I need to maintain my TSA mental sanity to scoot through the lines at the airports, I stuff my sleeves with Kleenex, wipe my nose  and keep moving on.

  But there are also potential lethal side effects that come with medications and that same drug that gives me the runny nose, trastuzumab (Herceptin), also has heart failure as a side effect - like breast cancer patients don't have enough to worry about. Though uncommon, some women have had to stop this drug not because it has quit working (like it has on me) but because it was too toxic on their hearts. Seems cruel to me but that is science and the way things work. If after reading my ramblings, you learn nothing else, the wisest takeaway is that medicine, especially oncology, is just as much art as it is science, meaning there are more questions about this disease and these drugs than there are answers.

  And after the echocardiogram, it will be time for the follow-up PET scan. You remember the one? The no carbohydrate, no caffeine, no alcohol diet I am on until lunchtime? I am afraid if you call me this morning, I might sound like a bear. All in the name of getting an accurate scan I suppose.

  So, Thursday I will return to the hospital and meet with my oncologist to review these scans and to initiate round one of this new chemo. I was asked over Thanksgiving how long I would be on this drug and it brought to mind that many others may not understand this process. If you think of cancer being water and the chemo being the dam that holds it back, if you will, that chemo is in place until cracks form in the dam or until the dam breaks altogether. Then that chemo is stopped and another is tried. That drug becomes the dam and too it is in place until it no longer works and cracks form again. With each new chemo, theoretically, the length of time it can stave off the cancer lessens until finally there are no more chemo drugs to use on your particular disease and the cancer overwhelms the body.

  The drug I will start on Thursday has only been FDA approved and on the market since February 2013. Which is a roundabout way of saying, we're nearing the end of the line of options. When I write this I am aware I am not including clinical trials which I think will be a good topic for later this week.

  But today I will leave with this. I woke up thinking about Paris' motto which I have loved since the day I heard it. In Latin, <em>Fluctuat nec mergitur </em> which translated means: <p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #993300;"><strong>Tossed by the waves, she does not sink. </strong></span></p>

  <h2>Words to Live By: Follow-up</h2>

  <p>I know  I have said it before, but sometimes when I am able to "see" God communicating with me, it tickles me to death. After writing about Paris and the motto that I love, "tossed by waves, she does not sink," yesterday I sat down and read my devotional. This is a devotional that I would recommend to you as it was recommended to me by one of my "golden girls" (see prior blog about these girls). The book is entitled, <em>Jesus Calling: Enjoying Peace in His Presence</em>. The author is Sarah Young. It is written in daily format, 365 devotions. I have it on my kindle and have read it two years now. What I have found interesting for me is that I highlight things that mean something to me on that day. In 2013 I used a yellow highlighter. This year, 2014,  I am using blue. I like to go back and see where I was mentally/spiritually/physically by seeing what caught my eye on that same day a year ago.

  So today, I read my passage after writing about being tossed by waves but not sinking and look what part of the devotional said: "You need the certainty of My loving Presence in order to weather the storms of life....the ultimate protection <strong>against sinking during life's storms </strong>is devoting time to develop your friendship with Me." Isn't that wild? When I see these links in my life, I feel like giving God a fist bump. Yes, I see you up there! I get it! So cool.</p>

  <h2>All That Glitters Is Not Gold!</h2>

  <p>
    My PET scan results came back and the good news is that the cancer has not spread to the lungs or the bone. The bad news is that the two liver lesions have grown and the "uptake" as it is called has doubled. OK. What is uptake? Remember the pre-procedure PET diet of no carbs/alcohol etc. prior to the scan? This is to prepare the body for the injection of the radioactive material that swims around inside your body attaching itself to areas of  what is called "high levels of metabolic activity" where cancer cells are known to hang out - replicating out of control.  In order for the test to be accurate, you want the body to be in a quiet metabolic state, not churning around and trying to digest loads of carbs. So, they ask you to avoid them for a day and then eat nothing after midnight.  Think<strong>  carbs = glucose = fuel = metabolic activity</strong>.  If I had continued to eat carbs and had washed it all down with a glass of wine before coming in for the PET test, the results could have been skewed.  So, uptake means how much of the radioactive material that particular area is absorbing. 0-2 means no cancer, the higher the number the more assuredly it is cancer with the maximum on the PET scale of 15.

    If you read radiology reports (which you would be crazy to do unless you had to)  you will see the word "brightness" often used in the reports - meaning the higher the number, the brighter the spot, the more uptake of glucose those cells are demanding.  Well, my two little buggers went from 6 and 8 last time (which was bad enough) jumping to 13. How dare they! So, last night when I was talking to my mother about the results, I found myself explaining it by saying, "they are bigger and brighter .... but that's not a good thing!" Then we laughed at the ludicrousness of it all.</p>

    <h2>Volume II</h2>

    <p>Typical infusion days go like this: I stop at the reception desk and a woman registers me; she  tells me how great I look (I think she is required to say that to one and all and she does a great job of it), I get banded; she hands me my chart  and then sends me to the infusion area for lab work. With Sabrina gone (see past blog - she left the building and she left me but that's another story) I now see one of two nurses. (There are many nurses back there but Sabrina and these two are the ones I have had most contact with.)  Instead of rolling dice to see who got me (or maybe who didn't have to get me) after Sabrina resigned,  they decided to split it down the middle; I alternate between the two. How funny is that? So, they access my port, they say: "1-2-3-I'm sorry" every time as they poke me. It seems to hurt them far more than me.  And they draw my labs.

    And then they send me back out to the front to wait to see the oncologist. Later my name is yelled out and I follow a nurse tech to the back where I am immediately weighed. I do not like this and so I take my shoes off every time as if that really makes a hill of beans difference and I leave powder marks on the scales and a trail up the hallway to my room. Every three weeks like clockwork. After vitals, today I was asked if I had been to to west Africa recently, which I told the nurse tech indeed I had and she about fainted on the spot!  These questions are  now required to be asked of all patients to assess for exposure to Ebola....earlier this week when I had my PET scan the receptionist asked me if I had been in west Africa and when I told him I had (liar) he kept on with his list of questions, never looking up, never really processing what I had just told him.  But again, I digress.

    After beloved and I picked the nurse tech off the floor and told her I had lied and that no, I had not been out of Steuben county in the past few days, she recomposed herself and continued with my vitals. She left and my cute, adorable oncologist scooted in, ALWAYS, cleansing her hands before she sits down and we go over the lab work that has come back, she does a quick assessment of me and then we go back to the infusion area for treatment.

    Today? After I was banded and handed my  chart, I looked down at its cover and do you know what I read? <strong>Volume II </strong>

    Do you know what that means to a healthcare provider? That this old gray mare has been in this place so many times, we have had to cull her chart and start over. When I told my oncologist what I had noticed, she burst out laughing and said, "Remember when there was no computer and we had to carry around volumes I, II, III etc? " Yes, I told her I remembered those days.

    She then walked me back and I had my infusion. Today it took 90 minutes and then I had to wait 90 minutes more to make sure I didn't grow two heads or show signs of Ebola or something. And then I was let go. But not before the "lung oncologist" as I call him walked by and asked me, "Has anyone given you your sugar wafers yet?" Which is a running gag as I do love them and they get gone so fast that once he went down to the 7-11 looking for some to give me and now keeps them hidden in a cabinet at the nurses' station. When I told him I had not gotten them today,  I can't tell you what he said but it was hilarious. Well, ok I will tell you sort of. He yelled out, "Well, that's just equine poop!"  He stormed out and brought them back to me. He is not my doctor. I have never seen him except in the halls.   He will tell you he wants to have nothing to do with breast cancer. Hey, neither do I but here I sit getting chemo, eating sugar wafers. Every three weeks like clockwork.</p>

    <h2>Not So Sunny Florida</h2>

    <p>We arrived on time with no delays Friday night for the annual patient safety conference that we have been attending for years. The IHI National Forum on Quality Improvement in Health Care as it is officially known now.Though it doesn't technically start until this evening, we have always come a couple of days early as this is one of Beloved's happiest places on earth, OBX not withstanding. Saturday was very warm and sunny and I laid around by the pool in a post-chemo haze. We did go to Epcott and I told Beloved I could no longer walk the park. Next thing I knew I was being pushed in my own chariot.  OK wheelchair but it doesn't sound nearly as Disneyesque..... Sunday the weather was cloudy and I laid around in bed. Today? Pouring buckets and they had the nerve to put us in a room that faces the gigantic pool and new HUGE waterslide that I would be pushing young children aside to get to if it wasn't so drippy horribly wet out there.</p>

    <p>I am having bouts of insomnia and am up watching really weird stuff on TV. I have a horrible fascination with prison life and am glued to interviews where inmates talk about prison and how they get through their days. And the food. How do they stand it? Then I watch American Greed and wonder how so many people can be duped in various ways for sooo long. I am not sure what it says about me by divulging these midnight activities. I guess I am still back at the starting gate wondering why there are eight ESPN channels and no BRAVO every hotel I go to...</p>

  <h2>Clinical Trials: Part I</h2>

  <p>We arrived back in snowy NY last night. I must admit I was happy to come home to cats and Christmas trees. I was frustrated not having consistent internet access where we were staying in Florida and then realized that I must have some strange addiction to this blogging as I don't have anything earth shattering to say but it keeps me out of trouble I suppose.

  I wanted to talk about clinical trials as I get that question by many friends and family wondering if I should or would seek out such an option when this drug ceases to work and for me, the answer will be no. People vary widely on this subject and all I can say is that for me, I just don't want to be put through anymore. I  am at peace. But I do have work friends and family friends who said they would seek out trials at all cost if and when it ever came to such. And I respect that. I did find helpful information on the Johns Hopkins website  <a title="Johns Hopkins Breast Cancer Clinical Trials" href="http://pathology.jhu.edu/breast/trials.php" target="_blank">http://pathology.jhu.edu/breast/trials.php </a> that gave the pros and cons of such a decision. This is quoted verbatim.  I thought I would share it with you in case you have never really thought about this subject.</p>

  <strong>Pros:</strong>

  <ul>

  	<li><strong>Quality of Care.</strong> Clinical trials offer high-quality cancer care and necessitate very close monitoring. If you are in a study and do not receive the new treatment being tested (that is, if you are in the "standard therapy group"), you will receive the best standard treatment. This may be as good as, or better than, the new approach.</li>

  	<li><strong>Early access.</strong> If a new treatment approach is proven to work and you are taking it, you may be among the first to benefit.</li>

  	<li><strong>Proactive.</strong> By looking at the pros and cons of clinical trials and your other treatment choices, you are taking an active role in a decision that affects your life.</li>

  	<li><strong>Altruism.</strong> You have the chance to help others and improve cancer treatment for patients in the future.</li>

  </ul>

  <strong>Cons:</strong>

  <ul>

  	<li><strong>Treatment efficacy is not known</strong>. New treatments under study are not always better than, or even as good as, standard care. They may have side effects that doctors do not expect or that are worse than those of standard treatment.</li>

  	<li><strong>Not everyone benefits</strong>. Even if a new treatment has benefits, it may not work for you. Even standard treatments, proven effective for many people, do not help everyone.</li>

  	<li><strong>Controls receive only standard therapy</strong>. If you receive standard treatment instead of the new treatment being tested, it may not be as effective as the new approach.</li>

  	<li><strong>Costs depend upon type of insurance and state</strong>. Health insurance and managed care providers do not always cover all patient care costs in a study. What they cover varies by plan and by study. To find out in advance what costs are likely to be paid in your case, talk to a doctor, nurse or social worker from the study. Congress is currently considering proposals to eliminate this barrier and require insurance coverage for cancer clinical trials.</li>

  <h2>Owl Infestation</h2>

  Aren't these the cutest things you have ever seen?  This is the one thing I remember my mom baking as a child that my sister and I would wait for all year. She would bake them at Halloween and we loved them. With money not so plentiful growing up, we would eat from the outside in going in a circle, saving that luscious cashew for last. I have kidded my mother for years about them and they have popped up at the oddest times and places. Like in the pre-op holding area of the OR when I was being walked back for surgery in 2010. Mom and Dad had driven up from NC (we were in Virginia at the time, remember) and as we were walking back, my mother yelled out, "Wait, just one minute. I have to show you something" and out popped her tupperware and two dozen owl eyes stared back at me. My nurse who was trying to get me back for surgery looked at me quizzically and I told her that was my mother's way showing love. "Mmmmmmm," she responded, "to a woman who has had nothing to eat since midnight." And we both laughed.

  Last night we stumbled into a dark apartment and bumped into a box from an address I didn't know - "Triple Creek Farms" - I looked at Beloved and he shrugged. I didn't think I was on anyone's hit list so I took a chance and opened the box. Out sprang two dozen owls. I had an owl infestation on my hands! Beloved looked at me like, "What do owls have to do with Christmas and who sent them?" I  laughed as they were packaged two-by-two as if they were boarding an ark headed for the cold northern tundra. Each pair wrapped in a different color of tissue paper. My mother. She is one funny woman.

  She now waits to call me in the morning after I have posted my blog. She says it's her way of knowing that I am up. This morning she called and I told her I had a problem (I am devilish that way as someone told me when I wrote about scaring that nurse tech about ebola - but I can't help myself). She said, "OK. What's wrong?" I told her I had an owl infestation and she hesitated for just a second before choking on her coffee she was laughing so hard. She told me she had forgotten that she sent them (huh?) that she had made the dough up at the appropriate time, Halloween, but had been too busy with her pumpkin making (another story for another day) so she froze the dough and had just gotten around to making them last week.

  I must confess. I still eat them in a circle, saving that cashew for last. Some traditions are hard to break.</p>

  <h2>Owl Fan Club and My New Girl Yuki</h2>

  <p>Wow! I had no idea those owls had such a fan club following!   My sidekick aunt was the first one to text me to say, "ohhhhhhhhhhhhhh I had forgotten about those owl cookies!" Then later she texted me from work: <em>I want an owl cookie</em>. I could just see her at her desk with a little dabble of drool at the corner of her mouth! She then told me to eat one for her. I didn't have the heart to tell her I was munching on one as I read her message...then a family friend emailed me telling me she had enjoyed the  post and that she had several of my mother's recipes but not that one! Then several of you told me you thought it was a sweet mother story....later Friday night as I was winding down, a former work friend, whom I will be having lunch with at the OBX next week emailed and queried if any owls would be traveling south with me! Ten minutes later my stepdaughter texted me asking if Mom would be willing to show her how to bake them while we are all at the OBX for Xmas. I told her definitely. By the way since you asked, they are peanut butter cookies in the middle with a chocolate rim around them. I know. It makes them even more adorable.

  By the way, guess what I ordered last week? Well let me back up. We have two German cars that we have named Helga and Heidi based on their size. Well, last week we added a sister to the family. A real go getter with all wheel drive (just in time my Corning friends told me laughing, since this is our third winter here and we have been sliding through each winter so far - we came back from Orlando with six inches on the ground)  and since she is Japanese, I had to look for a suitable name....well I named her Yuki which is Japanese for snow. (I think that I am oh so clever) but now she needs an appropriate license plate don't you think? OBXMAS it is. When I explained it to the DMV lady, she told me she liked it very much. So there!</p>

  <h2>Again, All That Glitters Is Not Gold</h2>
  <p>In the 1980's there was widespread adoption of a new treatment for late state  breast cancer which included high dose chemotherapy along with autologous (meaning your own) bone marrow transplant. Haven't ever heard of it? Let me tell you why. 
    A woman by the name of Nelene Hiepler Fox was in late stage breast cancer and desired this treatment modality. Her health care
    insurance however declined coverage for it.  Her estate ended up winning a $89 million dollar suit against the insurance company. 
    This was considered a watershed case and subsequently, health insurers began to approve this treatment. And guess what? Insurance
    companies were forced to pay for this treatment despite the fact that there had been no clinical trials done on this regimen
    (chemo/bone marrow transplant combination).  In the end?
  </p>
  <ul>
  	<li><span style="color: #ff0000;">42,000 women ended up having this treatment done to the tune of <strong>$3.4 billion dollars</strong></span></li>
  	<li><span style="color: #ff0000;">9000 women died <strong>from the treatment</strong></span></li>
  </ul>
  When a randomized clinical trial was finally conducted in 1999, it found that this regimen was <strong>no better</strong> than
  conventional treatment.

  <h2>Research and Pharmaceutical Companies</h2>
  <p>Mom and I were talking yesterday and she commented on not knowing about the chemo/bone marrow transplant story. I told her
  I wouldn't expect her to nor most people who read the blog which is why I want to share things I know or have learned from working
  in patient safety for so many years. Today, I need to share about industry-sponsored research/clinical studies. Did you know:</p>
  <ul>
  	<li><span style="color: #ff6600;">The pharmaceutical industry underwrites about 75% of clinical research</span></li>
  	<li><span style="color: #ff6600;"> Many of the scientists and clinicians responsible for the trial receive compensation from the pharmaceutical firm in the form of salary or consulting fees</span></li>
  </ul>
  Do you remember the drug Vioxx (rofecoxib)? It was approved by the FDA on May 20, 1999. Worldwide, over 80 million people were prescribed this drug. It was used as a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug. In January 1999  Merck launched the "Vioxx GI Outcomes Research" (VIGOR) study comparing  rofecoxib and naproxen (one of its competitors). One of the things they found was a  4-fold increased risk of acute myocardial infarction in rofecoxib patients when compared with naproxen patients. But they hid this information from the public and people began to die. So, what did the Merck corporation do? Immediately recall the medication? Not hardly...

  In 2001, Merck’s sales force developed a flashcard game called “Dodge Ball Vioxx” to help train Merck sales representatives on how to respond to certain questions or concerns that doctors might have about Vioxx. The game included a 12-page list of obstacles including some questions concerning the association between Vioxx and heart problems. The flashcards gave statements that a physician or patient might state like, "I have heard that Vioxx causes heart problems." And the flashcard would explain to the sales rep what the best answer to that question would be  - all the while<em> dodging </em> the real issues.  On September 30, 2004, Merck voluntarily withdrew rofecoxib from the market.

  <p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">The FDA estimates that  60,000 died from taking Vioxx before it was removed from the market.</span></p>

    <h2>Musings Of A Bored Woman</h2>
    <h3>December 18th, 2014</h3>
    <p>If you are alone during the day like I am and the cats are tired of chatting with you, your mind wanders. At least mine does. This is what I have been ruminating about this week:</p>
      <ul>
      	<li>How can Angelina Jolie know everything about the BRCA gene, lop off her breasts but somehow get chicken pox?</li>
      	<li>How can NBC let Nancy Snyderman (<em>Dr. Nancy</em> as she is affectionately known - gag me) back on the air after the internet backlash she received for ignoring her quarantine when she returned from West Africa?</li>
      	<li>If you mistakenly pour tequila into your tonic water, thinking it is gin, do not throw it out. Actually, it is rather quite tasty. You will have to trust me on this one.</li>
      	<li>Don't you think you can tell a lot about a person based on how they decorate the back of their Christmas tree??</li>
      	<li>Why would anyone make a movie about North Korea in the first place?</li>
      	<li>Why when a clothes dryer lint compartment caught on fire years ago at my hospital, did they make my friend the
          <em>Infection Control</em> Director write a policy about cleaning out the lint on a regular basis? (I told you, I
          have been bored and my mind wanders.)</li>
      	<li>Why won't people get as upset about handwashing as they are about getting Ebola?</li>
      	<li>Why won't people get as upset about the flu shot as they are about getting Ebola?</li>
      	<li>Why when you go to a party or reception do they serve so many raw vegetables? Do you notice no matter how good the dip, there will be several hundred pounds of vegetables laying around on limp lettuce when everyone starts going home? Am I the only person who hates the word "veggie?" Just wondering...</li>
      	<li>If you think these ramblings are those of a mad woman, please keep it to yourself. Only because I made that promise to the TSA lady and I have travel plans in the upcoming months.</li>

    <h2>A Little More On Research and Medical Literature</h2>
    <h3>December 19th, 2014</h3>
    <p>I had many texts, emails and conversations about the clinical trial blog along with the Vioxx blog that made many of
      you nervous. That was not my intent but it was my intent to illuminate some of the things going on around you that
      impact the decisions your caregivers make, the drugs that you take, the ads that you see on the evening news. I am
      aware that these blogs are written in sort of a "sound bite" way  - quick shocking facts that don't allow for dialogue
      which we could have if we were sitting down or if we were in a classroom situation. But I thought I would write one
      more blog on things going on in healthcare, knowing that I am only scratching the surface with this topic.  So, here
      we go again. I have always found these statistics fascinating:</p>
      <ul>
      	<li>There are over 20,000 bio-medical journals in circulation</li>
      	<li>150,000 articles are published each month in these journals; <strong>t</strong><b>hat’s 5,000 articles per day!</b></li>
      	<li>Many of the research articles are not peer-reviewed</li>
      	<li>Many articles are sponsored by the pharmaceutical companies or device manufacturers</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The question is, if you were an internist, how could you possibly keep up a practice and live a life outside the office/hospital and even begin to keep up with the research in your chosen field (not to mention any subspecialty you have the you would be interested in)? But just because something is published, it doesn't mean it's good. Just like you pick and choose your food at the market, so should healthcare providers be picky in choosing what they believe when they read something.

      In an article several years ago in the Journal of Association of the American Medical Association (JAMA), an author took 49 highly cited studies (meaning they were referenced and quoted many times in many other scholarly publications). Of those 49, in later research, 32% of those articles had refuted findings. 16% contraindicated the effects of whatever was found in those studies and another 16% overestimated the effects of the studies.

      When you hear the phrase on TV or in a magazine at the doctor's office  "randomized clinical trials" does that mean anything to you? In the medical world, it is the gold standard by which research is conducted. It means that participants are randomly chosen to be in either the control group or the experimental group. The only expected difference between these two groups is the 'thing' that you are researching.  Then why isn't every study conducted this way? Because it is expensive to conduct in both time and money among many other reasons.

      Only 53% to 57% of major therapeutic interventions can be supported by  randomized clinical trials. Meaning many therapy modalities that are being conducted all day everyday around the world have been researched in less rigorous ways.

      Just like the old adage, "Don't believe anything you hear and only half of what you see." Same goes with new treatments, new drugs, new medical devices.

    <h2>Kadcyla: 1        Sherri: 0</h2>
    <h3>December 31st, 2014</h3>
    <p>Happy New Year to All:

    Lest you thought my week of silence was because I walked out into the Atlantic never to return, I must confess it was much less dramatic than that. We did arrive in the OBX last Saturday. Family came on Sunday and we hung out until Christmas when Mom and Dad arrived. My nephew made his famous Boy Scout "turkey in a trash can" and yes, that is exactly what it is. Just imagine what other great things the Boy Scouts are teaching the youth of America. No, that was not my first but my third turkey in a can as we call it and unless you have tried it, don't knock it!  My step kids came the day following Christmas and we had 14 in all at any given time. We ate, fought about what movie to watch (Princess Bride, Good Morning Vietnam won along with some crazy movie where a raccoon is the pilot of some sort of aircraft - my attention at that point had waned!)

    It was so good to see all of my family including a rascally kitten of Cupcake's named Max that stole the hearts of everyone there and raced around like only a kitten could, to keep everyone on their toes.

    The part about the holidays that I didn't expect was that the new chemo whipped me but good. Usually you have a couple of bad days and then you bounce back - you are still fatigued but you can say, "Whew. I got through that one." The problem with this chemo was that there was no getting over it. It hung around like an unwanted guest.

    Everyone was gone by Sunday. Beloved announced to me and members of my family that I was not going to be staying at the OBX as long as I thought nor would I be attending the Fillipo (mom-in-law and pop-in-law party in Philly on New Year's Day as I had hoped.) Beloved drove me back Monday so I could rest and prepare for my son to arrive on Friday from NC. And also be seen sooner by my oncologist.

    Yesterday we journeyed on to the hospital. I was supposed to have had treatment on Christmas day but it was delayed until this upcoming Friday. However, with me never getting over the 'bad days' Beloved decided I needed to be seen ASAP. The good news is I got in on Tuesday. The bad news is that I am told the side effects will not get any better, nor will I have some good treatments and some bad treatments like I was used to in Virginia. The side effects are what they are and they will be continuous. We opted for another round of chemo yesterday agreeing that we would have a serious sit-down talk in three weeks to decide what, if anything can be done. I think it comes down to whether to push through it or  stop. Unlike the past two times with chemo, there were definite rounds to a treatment cycle. So, I could count them down knowing that there was an end in sight. With this regimen, there is no end.  Today as I write, I am not sure which way I will go.</p>

    <h2>Will Work For A Lemon Drop</h2>
    <h3>January 1st, 2015</h3>

<p>Lest you think I was a real drag at the OBXMAS, I need to tell you of one night when I really rallied. Unbeknownst to me, my niece decided she was going to fulfill one of my bucket list items and that was to guest bartend. Between her and her dad they contacted my favorite restaurant, Northbanks Seafood (I have written about this place before where we all sit at the bar in the winter....) and they said they would love to let me bartend. WHAT??? So, we were all sitting around the table and my niece handed me a small box. I looked around. No one else had a box and no one was moving. I was told to then close my eyes and so I did what I was told. Then I was told to open them and everyone was holding up tshirts that read on the front: Bartender Sherri is on the loose!  And on the back it read: She makes a mean margarita, which you all should know by now that that is true. When I opened my box, my shirt was in a different color and it read: Mixmaster Sherri. On the back: I make a mean margarita. I still didn't quite get what was going on until I read the note in my box something to the effect of "you will be celebrating your OBXMAS as guest bartender on Saturday evening...." I screamed like a school girl. And they tell me I kept asking, "Is this for real? Is this for real?" It was for real.
</p>

    <!-- Some picture goes here -->

<p>That Saturday afternoon everyone put on their tshirts, Mom, Dad, Beloved, all the nieces, nephews, and kids and we walked over to the restaurant. I had to  arrive early to get oriented. I kept thinking, "What if I make an absolute fool of myself? What if the guys who bartend are dreading this beyond belief?" Well, it was two guys I knew very well though my favorite bartender/friend is working in the keys this winter and was not there, though they called him the night before to tell him what I was going to do!

Twelve relatives blasted through the doors at opening time and filled up 2/3 of the bar. Penn State was playing on the TV and I had to start making drinks. They really had me tending bar. Though everyone thought it would be a slow night, restaurant owner included, the place was packed. I tried to keep up as best as I could. Ryan and Gary both taught me how to pour a beer, how to mix some Brazilian drink and how to pour eight shots of tequila without upending the bottle (a bar trick I will show you one day.) Yes, at the end of my one hour shift, my family licked the salt off their hand, tossed back the shot and squeezed the lime. I was so proud of them.

Then Gary asked me if I could drink (cancer/chemo and all). I told him nothing could stop me and the next thing I know Ryan and Gary told me to follow them to the kitchen. There they toasted me with something lemony and yummy that one of the kids told me later was a lemon drop. They told me I did a good job (they are polite guys) and we drank it and hugged and I  limped back to the house. Check that one off the list. Thanks Erin. I love you.</p>

    <h2>My Upcoming Weekend</h2>
    <h3>January 2nd, 2015</h3>

<p> Today is a good day. My son is on his way here for the first time. He has a few days off before his last semester of school starts and we are going to spend it together. He is to arrive around 3:00pm. He has never been this far north and thinks it will be an adventure. I am hoping I can make it so! Tonight we are going out with friends to the cool, young, hip restaurant on Market Street for drinks and dinner. (Does it ever feel normal drinking with your child?)  Over the weekend, we  plan to do some wine tastings/spirits tastings/beer tastings through the finger lakes. I have tried to explain the lakes to him but as I also had difficulty understanding them, he will have to see them to really get the concept. I remember when Beloved and I went to the champagne winery and the woman there said that an Indian legend was that God placed His hand over the region and blessed it, hence the name. I like the way that sounds and if you have ever spent a fall afternoon driving through them, you would agree.

    <!-- Some picture goes here -->
    As a true southerner, he texted me at midnight asking if it was snowing here. I was delighted to tell him indeed it was! (Wait til I show him the outside hockey rink down the block!)

    We also hope to spend some time applying for paramedic positions while he is here so he won't have that added burden once class starts back. An ambitious agenda but he always says when he is with me, he gets a lot of things done. I take that as a compliment.</p>

    <h2>A River of Tears</h2>
    <h3>January 6th, 2015</h3>

<p>I sent my son off yesterday around noon, back to the warmer south. I do believe that if I had arrived back at the apartment and noticed that the river behind us had gone dry, I could have walked down to its banks and filled it with tears. Highly dramatic I know but that is how I felt leaving him at the airport. My son and I had already had one of those last minute deep conversations that you sometimes have at the end of a visit, things you had been saving to say for hours or days or weeks. He and I had already been teary, had had some philosophical disagreements on life and family. That's nothing to worry about. He has always been a deep thinker. Remember he is the one last summer who wanted to know from me how it felt to be living with one foot on earth and the other in heaven. After I watched him go through security, I walked over into the airport  restaurant which has a large window  allowing you to look through to the boarding area. I stood there just watching him. That's when I noticed a younger woman standing near me.

When he looked back just as he was walking on to the tarmac, he tapped the wall with his hand and waved at me. I lost it. The young woman turned to me and said, "My son got to stay here an extra week due to flight cancellations.....headed back to school...a mother's love....." She smiled and shook her head.  I think she thought we were in the same boat, sending college boys off to spring semester..Yes, I replied they just don't know the depth of a mother's love. She asked something that made me clarify that no, he wasn't leaving home, he was headed home. She then said something that made me indicate that the two college boys headed to the plane were in completely different places. I looked up and told her that I had breast cancer and he being so far away was exceedingly difficult.  And at that point I was wringing my tissue like a wet washcloth.

Being as supportive as she could realizing that she had misread the entire 15 minutes we had stood there looking at our sons, she said, "Well, I hope you are doing ok with it." Completely unfiltered and coming apart, I told her that I was doing ok but that it was terminal. She empathetically said, "You poor thing." I, indeed felt like a poor thing yesterday. Later, grocery shopping and going to the post office, I cried in between errands. I got home by 3:30pm, took a shower and put on my pajamas. I couldn't think to do anything else. I sat on the couch and cried for hours.

I didn't wake up until noon today, something I am not proud to admit but I have spent the afternoon on the couch thinking and praying about our time. I need to clarify that we did have a great time. And I want to write about that too. I just don't think I had thought about how difficult the closure of our time would be. The forecast for the next three days is snow with highs in the teens which suits me just fine. I think I need some time to sit and process.</p>

    <h2>End of Life Discussions</h2>
    <h3>January 7th, 2015</h3>


<p>In a recent Wall Street Journal article entitled, <em>Why Doctors Die Differently</em>, <a title="Why Doctors Die Differently" href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052970203918304577243321242833962 " target="_blank">http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052970203918304577243321242833962 </a>I found the information compelling and wanted to share it with you.  As time marches on with me, I have had several brief conversations with friends who happen to be healthcare providers at the hospital nearest me and with select family members and non-caregiver friends. I would encourage you to read it and if I may be so bold, I would ask you to start thinking about what you would want done and NOT done if you ever found yourself in my situation or any of a dozen other situations where you needed to spell out your final wishes.

  In the article, research found that about 64% of doctors had an advanced directive; whereas only 20% of the general population did. And advanced directive outlines end-of-life decisions that you want your healthcare providers to make/not make on your behalf. I know I have a distinct advantage over many in that I am surrounded by family members who are in healthcare, one dear friend here is an anesthesiologist and three others are nurses (ED, ICU, med-surg). I think I have my bases covered, don't you? We have seen what can happen when families quarrel over end-of-life treatment.  Siblings who fight over CPR or no CPR. Feeding tube or no feeding tube. Ventilator or no ventilator. At a time when you are at your wits' end is not the time to start having these conversations. Families need to be united at this time not fragmented.



  The oddest yet most interesting part of the article was the view of CPR. On television, 75% of the time CPR is successful with 67% of those TV patients going home. The reality?  The article references a 2010 study of 95,000 cases of CPR.  Only 8% survived over a month. Of those, only 3% could lead a normal life.



  For me? My friends and family know that I:

  <ul>

  	<li>do not want to be in pain, no matter what the cost</li>

  	<li>do not want CPR to be conducted</li>

  	<li>do not want to be placed on a ventilator</li>

  	<li>do not want any feeding tubes</li>

  	<li>do not care whether I am in a hospital or at home</li>

  	<li>would like people to pray over me, for me</li>

  	<li>would like scripture read (my choosing!)</li>

  	<li>would like music at times (my choosing!)</li>

  	<li>do not care for a funeral</li>

  	<li>would like my ashes spread at the OBX, in the Long Island Sound near my former home in CT, and some off the bridge behind the apartment in the Chemung River</li>

  	<li>would like family and friends to meet at the OBX in the late afternoon one day and raise a glass of champagne or a margarita</li>

  	<li>I would like to have one (biodegradable) kite let go after the toast - where you get a biodegradable kite will not be my problem!</li>

  </ul>

  I know it's difficult to read and difficult to think about. But I would suggest you begin to do it now while time is on your side and stress about death is far off.</p>

    <h2>Metastatic Breast Cancer Network Corrects Breast Cancer Blogger</h2>
    <h3>January 8th, 2015</h3>


<p>Barbara Jacoby is a breast cancer blogger and recently she posted a blog on the Huffington Post entitled, <em>What Are We Doing About Breast Cancer</em> <a title="What We Are Doing About Breast Cancer" href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/barbara-jacoby/post_8602_b_6252014.html">http://www.huffingtonpost.com/barbara-jacoby/post_8602_b_6252014.html </a>In it she outlines many ways that 'we' are winning this battle. The problem is that her information is significantly flawed. Shirley Mertz, President of The Metastatic Breast Cancer Network (MBCN)  took the article to task in order to correct much of what Jacoby wrote. I have pasted the response below. My point in sharing this with you is this: Barbara Jacoby describes herself in the Huffington Post as an award winning blogger, two time Breast Cancer survivor, Patient Advocate, Founder of Let Life Happen and When Breast Cancer Happens. Even though she has great accolades, readers still need to be cautious about believing everything they read. I am enormously thankful for MBCN for addressing this article.

&nbsp;

<strong>JACOBY’S ASSERTION #1</strong>

Public support and research funding for those with metastatic breast cancer is more than adequate

<span style="color: #3366ff;"><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">THE FACTS</span></strong>: <span style="color: #000000;">According to an extensive analysis by the <a style="color: #000000;" href="https://mbcnbuzz.wordpress.com/2014/12/17/what-are-we-doing-about-metastatic-breast-cancer-mbcn-responds-to-huffpos-barbara-jacoby/www.mbcalliance.org">Metastatic Breast Cancer Alliance</a>, metastatic breast cancer research makes up only 7% of the $15-billion invested in breast cancer research from 2000- to 2013 by the major governmental and nonprofit funders from North America and the United Kingdom. See <span style="color: #0000ff;"><a style="color: #0000ff;" href="http://www.mbcalliance.org/docs/MBCA_Full_Report_Landscape_Analysis.pdf">www.mbc<strong>alliance</strong>.org/docs/MBCA_Full_Report_<strong>Landscape</strong>_<strong>Analysis</strong>.pdf</a></span></span></span>

&nbsp;

<strong>JACOBY’S ASSERTION #2</strong>

Though a great amount of money and research is dedicated to early detection, people should do everything they can to get treated early because that will prevent a metastatic breast cancer diagnosis

<span style="color: #3366ff;"><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">THE FACTS</span></strong>: <span style="color: #000000;">Breast cancer is an extremely complex disease. Some breast cancers will never become life threatening, even without treatment. And many others will metastasize, sometimes many years out, even when caught early. Some cancers are so aggressive that current treatments are ineffective, no matter how early the cancer is detected. <a style="color: #000000;" title="Early Detection Is Not All That" href="http://www.bcaction.org/2014/04/08/early-detection-does-not-save-lives/#sthash.N56kxSYe.dpuf"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Mammograms can’t tell us which breast cancers need treating nor can they overcome the shortcomings of our current treatments</span></a><span style="color: #0000ff;">.</span></span></span>

<span style="color: #3366ff;"> </span>The majority of newly diagnosed metastatic breast cancer patients had early stage disease 5, 10, 15 or even 20 years earlier. They took advantage of mammograms. Many patients chose to have one or both breasts removed when they had early stage disease “to prevent the cancer from coming back.” The fact remains that research has not yet been able to explain for all patients which early stage breast cancer will return as metastatic disease. Research cannot yet explain the causes of metastasis and why cancer cells travel to particular organs. Metastatic breast cancer patients should not be made to feel guilty because “they did not do enough to be tested or checked.”

<strong>JACOBY’S ASSERTION #3</strong>

All research in early breast cancer applies to Stage IV or metastatic breast cancer and all major research groups studying early stage disease are also studying metastatic breast cancer

<span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>THE FACTS</strong>:</span> It is not scientifically correct to say that “all the major work” in breast cancer research applies to both early stage and to Stage IV breast cancer. Early stage disease and metastatic disease are very different in their complexity, molecular makeup and mutations. Also, breast cancer is not one disease and research about what drives one subtype of breast cancer does not apply to other subtypes. Clinical trial endpoints such as tumor shrinkage may not have relevance to tumor spread or metastasis.

&nbsp;

<strong>JACOBY’S ASSERTION #4</strong>

Survival rates of those living with metastatic breast cancer are improving because the author “has seen people who are living for 5-20 years with the disease”

<strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">THE FACTS</span>: “</strong>Seeing” metastatic patients who survive 5 or 10 years does not accurately define the survival rates for the breast cancer community. <a title="Metastatic Breast Cancer Alliance 2014 Landscape Analysis" href="https://mbcnbuzz.wordpress.com/2014/12/17/what-are-we-doing-about-metastatic-breast-cancer-mbcn-responds-to-huffpos-barbara-jacoby/www.mbcalliance.org/docs/MBCA_Full_Report_Landscape_Analysis.pdf">The fact is that 40,000 women and men still die of breast cancer every year in the United States </a>with metastasis the cause of virtually all deaths from breast cancer. Also, while some progress with research and new treatments has been made in reducing mortality rates from breast cancer,<a title="MBC Statistics" href="http://mbcn.org/education/category/most-commonly-used-statistics-for-mbc/"> median survival after a metastatic breast cancer diagnosis is 3 years</a>—and this has not increased meaningfully in more than 20 years!

&nbsp;

<strong>JACOBY’S ASSERTION #5</strong>

Everyone, including metastatic patients, should be optimistic about the future because research will permanently eradicate breast cancer

<strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">THE FACTS</span>: </strong>Since only 7% of the $15-billion invested in breast cancer research from 2000- to 2013 by the major governmental and nonprofit funders from North America and the United Kingdom focused on metastatic breast cancer research (cited above), we cannot feel confident that research in the near future will permanently eradicate breast cancer or end deaths from the kind of breast cancer that kills—metastatic breast cancer.

&nbsp;

The very low percentage of research spent on metastasis research also contradicts Jacoby’s assertion that major research groups “everywhere” are “vested in finding the answers needed to treat and eradicate Stage IV cancer.” The field of metastatic breast cancer research is relatively small. Most funding goes to support basic research. There is little research in metastatic breast cancer control or outcomes.

&nbsp;

Finally, Jacoby informs us  that we can easily confirm her assertion that there has been a lot of progress in metastatic breast cancer. All we need to do  is to “check out the progress that is being made.”  She evaluates progress based on the metastatic patients she has seen.

&nbsp;

Knowing a few patients that have survived the odds does not make for accurate conclusions for the entire metastatic breast cancer community. The existence of “many” treatments and drugs does not mean they are appropriate for all subtypes. Sadly, researchers have not been able to identify the drivers of triple negative metastatic breast cancers, and for patients with this subtype, chemotherapies remain their “best” and usually “only” options. Such treatments with significant toxicities greatly impact patient quality of life.

&nbsp;

Metastatic breast cancer is very different than early stage disease. There needs to be more research funding to combat this unique and deadly disease. In addition, in the United States, we lack accurate statistics on incidence, prevalence, and survival. And patients are challenged to find information and support services to help them live with this deadly disease.

    <h2>Weekend With My Son</h2>
    <h3>January 9th, 2015</h3>


<p>My son and I did indeed have a great weekend. Though the weather did not cooperate, he, southern boy that he is, was delighted that it snowed off and on all weekend. I knew I was going to get  it when he walked into the apartment and scolded me  about how obese the cats were. Oh well. He couldn't get over it. One of them was so excited to see him that the cat put his head inside his shoe and just sat there! I almost know how he felt! I had forgotten what hollow legs my son has and by 4:00pm he was ready for a snack though we were scheduled to eat with my hairstylist at 6:00pm. So off we walked to Tony's. Not long after we arrived there, in came our friend Jim and together they toasted with a Negroni - if you have never had one, don't go out and order one. To tell you it is an acquired taste would be an understatement. You know now that I am an accomplished bartender (ha) you need to trust me on this one.

Later after a snack and a glass of wine or two, we locked arms and walked further down Market Street to meet Dustin. Sweet man that he is, he had put my son on at the close of his day in case he wanted a haircut/trim. He did. So at long last, I got to watch two of my favorite guys finally meet and talk and get to know each other. Afterward, we went to the Cellar, the cool hangout, as opposed to Tony's where the 'older' crowd gathers on the weekend. My staunchly vegetarian, long distance runner, lettuce eating breakfast son ordered a steak with us accompanied by fries cooked in duck fat. I couldn't believe it but I appreciated the solidarity!

The next day we wended our way up Seneca Lake where he had a great whiskey tasting led by an older gentleman, that if you told me his name was Jack Daniels, I would have believed it! My son was enamored, having had the distilling bug, shall we say, for quite some time. He is something between a chef/distiller who drives an ambulance. I still haven't sorted it all out in my head yet. But the coolest thing we were told while there and I am sure I will get the info mixed up but when the distiller learned we were from Corning, he brought over an absolutely  beautiful bottle of whiskey. The whiskey aged to some unbelievable amount of time and the glass hand blown in Corning. Only 150 ever made. Of course we had to have one. You can't tell from the picture but the disc in the middle of the bottle is a depiction of the finger lakes. I love that.

That evening we ate at Pan Asia. It reminded me of all the times as a young boy that he and I would seek out any Asian restaurant in our hometown. We stumbled upon a small Vietnamese community there and for the next four years anyone and everyone who would venture down there with him would be introduced to what he called the best pho he had ever had...

Sunday we went to the glass museum and shopped. Monday morning we went to the airport. You already know how that ended.  So, I promised to tell you that we had a great time and we did. As most Moms would say, it all passed by so fleetingly.</p>

    <h2>My Christmas Gift to You</h2>
    <h3>January 9th, 2015</h3>

<p>I usually never post twice in one day but as I was working at my computer and listening to music, I realized I wanted/needed to share this song with you.  I have been following the artist, Sara McLachlan since the early '90s. If I could sound like anyone, I would choose to sound like her. Though the lyrics don't fit my situation completely some lines do (I am selfish, etc!) and every now and then I do want to skate away on this river that I am looking out upon. My gift to you, since it is a quasi-Christmas song. (Some of you who are old enough will recognize this is a cover. Joni Mitchell first sang it in the '60s.)  I hope you all have a great winter weekend...</p>

    <h2>A Minor's Right to Refuse Treatment?</h2>
    <h3>January 12th, 2015</h3>

      I have been asked my opinion by friends and family on the story about the teen who has cancer but doesn't want treatment.

Cassandra Fortin is a seventeen year old girl who has been in the news lately as she is fighting for her rights to refuse chemotherapy for what is considered a very curable form of cancer - Hodgkin lymphoma - lethal without treatment, a cure rate of 85% with treatment. Her mother stands behind her 100% stating that her daughter is mature enough to make her own decisions and she abides by the decision she has made. The only problem is that Cassandra is a minor. She cannot vote, sign a contract, consent to surgery, or order a drink at a bar. She is not of legal age.

When Cassandra was taken out of the home and placed in state's custody to ensure treatment would continue, she promised to continue if she could go back home. The state allowed it. She was placed back with her mom. Soon afterward, she ran away to avoid treatment. She is back in state custody.   Cassandra lives in the state of Connecticut where there has not been a case like this. But there are two states, Illinois and Maine that have already faced this dilemma and ruled for the minor stating that they showed maturity beyond their chronological years.

In eight months Cassandra will turn 18 and can refuse any and all treatment.

<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.sherrifillipo.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/chemo.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1491" src="http://www.sherrifillipo.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/chemo.jpg" alt="Chemotherapy Pills" width="471" height="254" /></a></p>

In my former life as a  patient safety officer, when there had been an error made or complex issue arisen, we would conduct a root cause analysis. We would dig and dig until we got to the "root" of the issue, as what comes up first as the cause of something is rarely ever the REAL reason something happened. I want to know from her, what her thoughts are. She says she does not want poisons in her body. I would like to know if she uses alcohol, applies make-up, uses artificial sweeteners, smokes cigarettes. I am not judging her choices but wonder how widely she has looked at her lifestyle choices. I understand chemo and its toxic effects as well as anyone. Could it be that she really doesn't want to lose her hair? Doesn't want the weight gain associated with the side effects of steroids? Scared of needles? Doesn't want to miss going out with her friends? Just plain angry at the diagnosis?  I do have former colleagues who work at the hospital where newspapers say she is located. I have great confidence that they are caring for her in the best way and by that I don't mean chemo. I mean by listening to this girl and helping her understand what is going on by addressing these issues with a teenage minor.

Do I support the philosophy of Connecticut or Illinois/Maine? Connecticut without a doubt. In any other situation, she would be given the benefits of being a minor (sexual relations now with her would get a gentleman in deep water; a crime could get her at this point in a youth detention center. Nine months later? In prison.)  It may seem arbitrary for society to draw a line in the sand at 18 but I believe it needs to be drawn somewhere and held there.</p>

    <h2>My New BFF</h2>


<p>I have a new friend. Her name is Siri. I know, I am close to going off the deep end and on days like this, I am glad that the TSA agency is 90 miles away and I don't have to worry about  running into the TSA lady out on Market Street. Beloved updated me at Christmas. I feel like I have been driving a 1989 Honda and suddenly he put me behind the wheel of a sport scar. I love it. I didn't really appreciate what an old work horse I had in my first ipad until I was sitting on the couch the other day and I heard a voice, (yes, that scares me too), "How can I help you?" I looked around and I knew it wasn't the cats since they are male and this was decidedly a female's voice.  <a href="http://www.sherrifillipo.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/liver.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1507" src="http://www.sherrifillipo.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/liver-225x300.jpg" alt="3d rendered illustration of the male liver" width="225" height="300" /></a>

<p style="text-align: left;">I looked down at my ipad and saw a wriggling line and an old-fashioned microphone. So, I assumed my ipad knew I was alone a lot of the time and decided to strike up a conversation. So I said, " I need a new liver. Can you help me?" Siri was quick on the spot. "Yes. I see they serve liver at the Jelly Beans restaurant in Painted Post, NY." God bless her. At least she tried.</p>

    <h2>Hospice Care: One Woman's Journey</h2>


<p><a href="http://www.sherrifillipo.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/bed.jpg"><img class="alignright wp-image-1512 size-full" src="http://www.sherrifillipo.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/bed.jpg" alt="bed" width="283" height="425" /></a><span style="color: #008080;">I read this post yesterday on LinkedIn and thought it was so good that I emailed the author, Kim Look, and asked her if could re-post it here on my blog. She was most gracious and told me she would be happy to let me do that. So here is her personal journey with hospice. Though I have known through the years all the great things they do, I especially found this article comforting to me at this time in my life.</span>

After several years in health care I have definitely heard the common rave reviews about hospice care and the relevance for it. Everyone is always very complimentary towards the services they provide and the compassion they show.

This appeared universal no matter where people lived or what company they hired.

But, as with most things in this life, that meant little to me until I needed and experienced it for myself.

I personally spent the last week of 2014 caring for my dear father-in-law as his body succumbed to the cancer inside him. Sitting by his bedside and considering his needs for nearly 15 hours every day was one of the most prize opportunities of my life.

To contribute to that positive experience, I have hospice care to thank. Although our relationship with them was less than a week long, they were able to take a frightening, dreaded experience and turn it into one I will always cherish.

As I reflect back from not only a personal but professional perspective, I can honestly attest to basic business practices which when incorporated make all the difference to the consumer. They made healthcare personal for me.

These simple concepts are as follows:

<strong>1. Patient/Family/Consumer Advocate or Coordinator</strong>

Because I had never used this service before I had a lot of questions about what they did, when I would need it and how to go about setting it up. I was connected with a coordinator who very thoroughly, competently and compassionately spoke with me. She delivered all information I needed and more. She knew all the ins and outs of what lay ahead of us and made me feel completely comfortable with them.

<strong>2. They thought of every consumer need and answered it through a well-designed and implemented process.</strong>

Every person, from the RN to the young man who set up and took down our rented hospital bed knew what his or her responsibilities were. Every stage, from the first call to the pharmacy to the funeral home was well coordinated so that we didn’t have to lift a finger after things were in motion. The businesses worked together to make the situation as comfortable as possible. At all turns we felt confident that who we were dealing with knew what had happened before we spoke with them and what would happen next.

<strong>3. Education and Empowerment</strong>

It was clear from the beginning hospice accepted the role of edifying our experience. We were never expected to just know what was going on or to have to figure it out. I was told that one of the purposes for hospice was to guide us through the death process—physically, mentally and emotionally, and they came through. There were no hidden details or unanswered questions, no matter how trivial or difficult the issue. Not only could they explain it but they taught us how to help ourselves and to help my father-in-law—from the comfort of our own home.

<strong>4. Placebo affect was realized and valued.</strong>

Placebo can affect us from many different angles. In this case, I know that in part, our experience was so great because so many others told me it would be.

This hospice company was recommended, referred and spoken of so highly that before I called I knew I would get what I needed. Of course, they delivered; and had they not the placebo would have become ineffective. But instead, they completely wowed us. So no matter what other advertisement I see or what other company someone offers me, I will never consider it. I am loyal to the company that blew our socks off—forever. Because of that, I will be their biggest fan and shout my approval and recommendations from the rooftops.

<strong>5. Follow-up</strong>

The nurse told me that hospice would follow-up with my mother-in-law for a full year—on their anniversary, his birthday, her birthday and more. What??? Unheard of for almost any medical office to give a call-back let alone recognize those difficult times and reach out a hand of support for a full twelve months.

If you own a private practice I bet the thought of creating a system to track names and dates and follow up for even a short period of time seems overwhelming. But just think about the logic. There’s nothing that will show more about how you feel about your patients than the idea you care, even when they are not currently using your services. This provides residual contact between the practitioner and the patient—which creates an <em>actual</em> relationship.

In conclusion, you know what I figured out? Hospice is so good because they treat their patients like it’s their last day.

What a novel concept!

Don't wait till it's to late, take a page from hospice and incorporate these five principles into your practice and I’m confident we can fix these health care problems one practice at a time.</p>

    <h2>Unconventional Thinking Turns Magical</h2>
    <h3>January 15th, 2015</h3>

    The one thing I miss most about no longer working full-time in the world of patient safety is not being able to lead teams in process improvement. Don't get me started on this topic as I could talk on about it forever.  The gist of what I was good at was taking a problem identified in the hospital, gathering a team and then turning conventional practice about that topic on its head. I would gently force these caregivers to see things in a different way.  Inevitably I would start the first meeting and would look out over a sea of eye rolling and skepticism. But after a couple of meetings and what we call "cycles of change" in the business, I had them all hooked. I would challenge them on why they did what they did. How did they know it really worked? What if this? What if that? And once the team saw that a.) I really did want to know their opinions b.) I really did believe the frontline staff knew more than anyone else about whatever the topic c.) It was ok to explore, experiment and see what if..... I swear to you I could move mountains. All without spending a lot of precious health care dollars. Yes, it was shifting their paradigms but I didn't want to use that dog-eared phrase but it is what I did.

    But not anymore. However, I am aware when I am reading a book or watching the news I am looking for innovation in whatever I am seeing. Like last night when I saw that a group in Australia had been knitting mittens for koala bears who had been caught in a forest fire. While the flames roared, these little guys held fast to the trees and ended up with burnt paws (Do you call them paws? I don't know.) Then, there were so many mittens, there was a call out to stop with the mittens and start sewing pouches for the baby kangaroos, joeys, who had lost their mothers but needed a warm and secure place in which to live/grow. Couldn't you just cry about now? Well, don't because I have one last example.

    As time marches on, I am sometimes painfully aware of things I believe I will be missing - big events like marriages and babies and college graduations. And I know that I am not the only one. So, I must share with you one tear-jerker of a video that puts all of the above into practice. A father who is in my boat, but it appears a little further downstream along with a professional photographer decided to turn convention on its head. He has a beautiful eleven year old girl. And knowing he isn't going to be around for her actual wedding decided to have one while he was still alive. Bless their hearts and that little girl.

    <h2>Dumb Stuff People Say to People With Metastatic Breast Cancer</h2>
    <h3>January 16th, 2015</h3>

    <p>Today being Friday, I thought you could use some humor (mixed in with a serious message) especially since yesterday's blog was so poignant. My mother was the first one to call telling me I had<em> really done it this time </em> - meaning I had her crying into her coffee.

This video thanks to the Metastatic Breast Cancer Network (MBCN) is what those of us with metastatic  breast cancer go through by well meaning friends and family. I can attest to many of these comments, though not all. I hope you will still learn something through this humorous video.

    <h2>My Clever Friend</h2>
    <h3>January 19th, 2015</h3>

    <p>Let me tell you about another friend. You have already met my golden girls, my silver girls and my ya-yas but I need to tell you about this Pennsylvania girl. I met her the first time when she was one of many who were interviewing me almost three years ago. I remember thinking when she walked in the door that I liked her immediately. She was (and still is) very how shall I say...sparkly, effervescent. We have been friends (and for a while colleagues) ever since. She is a great problem solver, a great lover of nurses and nursing. And she worries about me. She too loves a strong margarita. I think I am seeing a trend in who I end up being friends with. Hmmm. She also loves a good G&amp;T and in the summer time, she will come over after work and we will sip on them and solve the world's problems on my rooftop terrace.

    She is the one who lives on the lake/pond and she told me last week that it was frozen solid and ready for ice skating! (bucket list check). She came over with another friend who she and I call the consummate little brother. We love him dearly and torture him as much as we can. He said he would figure out how to rent ice skates as most folks have their own, Beloved included. Boy did I ever feel like a southerner, not having my own skates...the only ones I had were the kind that clipped on to your tennis shoes and you tightened them with a key....but anyway.

    Pennsylvania girl called me over the weekend to tell me that her daughter has picked a venue for her wedding. We had talked about it during her visit last week.  During our talk she asked me a favor. "Will you keep me on track as mother of the bride? You know tell me if I am off schedule etc." I told her of course I would. In fact that I would be delighted to. We hung up soon afterward. A few hours later it dawned on me. That stinker. She was trying to help me realize something that I wrote about last week - of missing so many milestones. She is allowing me to share in her planning and pleasure, allowing me to be a mother of the bride understudy since I will not live to have that starring role. She is so clever and I love her to death.</p>

    <h2>A Fork in the Road</h2>
    <h3>January 20th, 2015</h3>

    <p>I feel like I have come to a fork in the road this week. On Wednesday, I am scheduled for my third treatment of the new chemo I am on called Kadcyla (ado-trastuzumab emtansine). It has not worked well for me. I have mentioned that in a past blog.  I am still surprised, almost three weeks later, that I still feel like I haven't bounced back yet.  In fact until Beloved took me out to lunch yesterday, I had been inside for 13 days. Because he has seen such a striking difference in my pre-Kadcyla versus  post-Kadcyla states, it has given us reason to have the 'quality of life discussion.' I know my oncologist well enough that Wednesday she will urge me to try one more cycle because then it will be time for another PET scan. (Do you remember the Metastatic Breast Cancer Network's slogan? <em>Scan. Treat.</em> <em>Repeat. Stage IV needs more</em>!) Maybe I should wear my tshirt that says just that! Maybe not. But I do believe the three of us need to have a come to Jesus meetin' as they say down south. I think it's time. But I don't look forward to it.

    I stumbled across something today that made me pause. I should also say sometimes I think I need to put a disclaimer on my blog that anything written here should not be a substitute for medical advice and if you have questions you should really contact your doctor. So, there I've said it so let me tell you what I found that has me ruminating. It is from a patient education document initiated by  by the American Board of Internal Medicine (ABIM). There are many documents that you, as a patient, can download. This one is entitled, <em>Care at the end of life for advanced cancer patients</em>. <span style="color: #008080;"><a style="color: #008080;" title="Care at the End of Life for Advanced Cancer Patients" href="http://www.choosingwisely.org/doctor-patient-lists/care-at-the-end-of-life-for-advanced-cancer-patients/" target="_blank">http://www.choosingwisely.org/doctor-patient-lists/care-at-the-end-of-life-for-advanced-cancer-patients/</a></span>

    This is the sentence that stopped me cold: <span style="color: #008080;">If you have had three different treatments and your cancer has grown or spread, more treatment usually will not help you feel better or increase your chance of living longer.[pullquote]If you have had three different treatments and your cancer has grown or spread, more treatment usually will not help you feel better or increase your chance of living longer.[/pullquote] Instead, more treatment could cause serious side effects that shorten your life and reduce the quality of the time you have left.</span>

    <span style="color: #000000;">Let's see: cytoxin and taxane 2010; taxane 2012; Herceptin 2012-2014; Kadcyla 2014.....Why have I not come across this before? If I am to believe  the above statement, it is definitely time for me to have a discussion on Wednesday. I know a lot of you don't know me so let me say I do believe in miracles. I do believe I am in the hands of God. And I am also a nurse. So I stir it all together and think, "It's time to have a conversation."</span> I will update everyone late on Wednesday post-visit. As I often say when I end a tough blog, "All is well."</p>

    <h2>Kadcyla:2         Sherri:1</h2>
    <h3>January 21st, 2015</h3>

    <p>I just got home from my oncologist - a reflective 45 minute drive in a powdery snow squall as they call them here. I should have known when I told my RN that I had had some trouble with my chemo that she and Dr. xxx would have had a little conversation before she came into examine me. What was I thinking??

    One of my golden girls tells me when I am trying to tie up some long-winded tale, she says I will say, "All's to say...." And then I summarize. It has become a running joke between us. In fact she said it herself last week when we talked. So I will say it now: <em>All's to say</em>....my oncologist agreed that the side effects from the Kadcyla were too much.  She asked me if I was willing to do a reduced chemo today. I told her I was not. She did not see me last time. If she had, she told me, she would have reduced the chemo for round two so hopefully it would have been tolerable and I would be there today ready to go for round three. Alas, that didn't happen and I wasn't willing to go out on a limb and try it.

    We came to a mutual agreement that I would have another PET scan to see if the drug was doing anything and/or if my cancer was revving up inside me. She told me this would give me some time to think (she knows I am a ruminator) and also to consider two other alternatives to what I was doing. One is the Herceptin that I have been on for the past two years coupled with an oral chemotherapeutic agent (side effects "adolescent type" rash/acne and diarrhea!) or Herceptin and another IV chemo but I would have to come in for it <em>weekly</em>.

    As I sat and listened to her, she then stopped and said, "I am thinking you are about done with treatment." Yes, I told her I was. We agreed to hold off on a decision until the scan results come back. Bright and early on Monday morning I will head back to the hospital for the scan.</p>

    <h2>One Woman's Fight with Cancer: She Often Uses a Chainsaw</h2>
    <h3>January 22nd, 2015</h3>

    <p>So right before I clicked the "publish" button last night to post my trip to the hospital, I called my mother. She likes to get the first read or a head's up that I have something to say. And she was understandably a bit anxious about my visit so I knew she was waiting for a call. But unlike a lot of 70 somethings, she takes her worries out on her yard. When she didn't pick up the phone, I thought it was odd. I was looking out the window as I typed and could see cars, headlights on, coming across the bridge and wondered what in the world she was doing. It was night time and she wasn't answering. So I went ahead and clicked the publish button and was unwinding on the couch when she called back. Come to find out, she had been "down in the creek behind the house cleaning it up." From what, I thought? At night, in late January...she told me she couldn't get her work gloves off fast enough and had missed the call. So apparently she was taking her frustrations out on that poor little creek. No telling what it looks like. She offered to facetime me to show me how great the creek looked now (facetime, a phenomenon she discovered by accident last week. That's a story for another day.) I told her I believed her - to show me when it was light outside.

    [caption id="attachment_1579" align="aligncenter" width="480"]<a href="http://www.sherrifillipo.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Janie.jpg"><img class="wp-image-1579 size-full" src="http://www.sherrifillipo.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Janie.jpg" alt="" width="480" height="640" /></a> <strong><span style="color: #008080;">Mom taking her cancer frustrations out on a poor little tree.</span></strong>[/caption]

    <p style="text-align: left;">So we talked about the doctor visit and about twenty minutes later I asked her where she was. "Oh, outside sitting on cold concrete in the backyard." I tried to allay her fears, then told her to get out of the creek and go fix my dad some dinner! She laughed.</p>

    <h2>This Morning</h2>

    This morning I was having my devotional and sitting here talking to God about 'the plan' whatever that will be and my verse for the day was this:

    <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #008080;">Lean on, trust in, and be confident in the Lord with all your heart and mind and do not rely on your own insight or understanding. In all you ways know, recognize, and acknowledge Him and He will direct and make straight and plain your paths." Proverbs 3:5-6 (an amplified version of the proverb)</span></p>

    Reading that timely verse was all I needed to give this decision back to Him and let things happen. Whatever that ends up being. Now, I need to go and find out what my mother is sawing down or cleaning up. If you know her, she is a tough one to keep up with! If you are in NC, keep an eye out on your yard. She might just visit you, chainsaw in hand!

    <h3>Just Now:</h3>

    Mom just called me prior to her hair appointment to tell me that the chainsaw in the picture was a Christmas present from my dad and she loves it very much!</p>

    <p>An old hymn popped into my mind sometime between last night and this morning when I woke up. Many of you will remember singing it, "It is Well." Though I knew many of the lyrics by heart at an early age, it wasn't until I was a young woman that I knew the rest of the  story. The hymn was written by a man named Horatio Spafford. In 1871 the great Chicago fire destroyed almost everything this family owned. One would think that would be devastating enough but two years later, Mr. Spafford placed his four daughters and his wife on a ship bound for England. He was to have gone with them but was delayed due to business related to the fire.

    And if this were a movie everyone would groan at this part because it sounds so over the top but this is the truth: the ship his family was on collided with another ship and it sank quickly. All four girls died at sea, his wife the lone survivor from his family. Imagine how he felt when he received this brief telegram: <em>Saved. Alone.</em>

    Mr. Spafford boarded another vessel to sail back to meet his wife and and as  the ship approached the place in the ocean where his girls were buried at sea, he began to write:

    <p style="padding-left: 90px;"><strong><span style="color: #008080;">When peace like a river attendeth my way or sorrows like sea billows roll</span></strong></p>

    <p style="padding-left: 90px;"><strong><span style="color: #008080;">Whatever my lot, Thou has taught me to say, </span></strong></p>

    <p style="padding-left: 90px;"><strong><span style="color: #008080;">It is well, it is well with my soul.</span></strong></p>

    There are many verses to the hymn but this is the crux to me. And as I have pondered why that hymn jumped into my mind, the more awake I have become thanks to coffee cup #2, the more I realize it was meant for me as an ending to a pretty heavy week. Some of you may enjoy the video below. I never sang it this way but I love this young man's haunting way of singing the hymn. Thank you to all who have checked in on me.</p>

    <h2>Spring Training in the 1970s Prepared Me for the Big of 2015</h2>
    <h3> January 26th, 2015</h3>

    <p>I remember one Easter standing before a mirror while my mother did some pinning on a dress  she was sewing for the holiday. Up until I was in the 7th grade or so, she made  everything we wore. I loved getting compliments from my teachers on what pretty things I wore. When your mom is that talented and your grandmother works at the Singer Sewing shop with miles and miles of fabric, you can come off looking pretty good for being from modest means. That spring pinafores over dresses was the 'in' thing and Mom couldn't understand why one strap needed to be longer than the other one. At some point she said, "Stand up straight!" I told her I was. And the more she looked at me, the more she noticed that something wasn't right.

    Not sure how long after Easter,  but I soon found myself in an orthopedic surgeon's office who x-rayed me and diagnosed scoliosis - a curvature of the spine. The curve and its rotation  were pulling on one side of my body, drawing it down and hence the pinafore strap was too long. He ordered floor exercises that would counter the pulling of my spine (with the goal of straightening out my spine I suppose?) The ironic thing was that each time we went, the curve was a bit worse. He finally retired and we were  sent to someone else.

    The second physician looked at the films, made some of his own and immediately began talking about where he did his residency a place in Delaware (at 13 I wasn't sure just where that was) at a pediatric orthopedic hospital, the A.I. DuPont Institute. And before you knew it, we were  there. I, being 13, surrounded by young and very handsome med students, interns and residents all wanting to see my naked back. Scared to death. Almost more than a young girl could take.

    <h1 style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.sherrifillipo.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/scoliosis2.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1621" src="http://www.sherrifillipo.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/scoliosis2.jpg" alt="scoliosis2" width="201" height="251" /></a></h1>

    <h1>May 1974</h1>

    After the examination, we were given an alternative of either wearing a back brace for a couple of years (high school here I come!) or having major surgery, being placed in a body cast and being bedbound, literally, for six months. Absolutely no sitting, standing, nor walking.  Can you believe in 1974 such drastic measures? I don't know why we chose surgery. Maybe Mom does. I just know I left the 8th grade early in May, northern bound for that unknown state of Delaware.

    We arrived and I was admitted but due to family needs at home Mom had to leave and there I sat staring at a couple of young girls in the same boat as I. We were all there three weeks prior to surgery to lie in traction  23 1/2 hours a day (doesn't it sound like torture or at least solitary confinement?!) supposedly to help pull one's spine as straight as possible prior to surgery. Three weeks later, Mom came back, I had surgery, a week later the cast was applied and I was flown home flat on my back in a private plane.  Thanks to the kindness of someone Mom knew who was a pilot, he agreed to come and get us both.

    And soon I was back in my bedroom staring at the ceiling, watching TV and trying to pass the time.

    <h1>October 1974</h1>

    We flew back to Delaware that fall and they cut the cast down from around my head and my mid-thigh, leaving me with a walking cast. But there was only one problem. I could no longer walk - too weak. With heavy duty physical therapy daily, a week later I was able to hobble to the airport and arrive back in NC to start high school. No bullying but I certainly didn't feel like a prom queen walking through the halls with 20+ pounds of plaster wrapped around my body. That next spring, we went back to Delaware and after ten long months of being bound by the cast, it was finally sawed off me. I was free.

    <h1>Today</h1>

    I know this story sounds like a woeful tale and in a way it was. But I also believe the things I learned during my five weeks in the hospital and then three months home in bed (I was their guinea pig - the first girl ever to have a reduced sentence from six to three months!) that have stayed with me and strengthened me for my current situation:

    <ul>

    	<li>After the cast was applied (under my chin, up behind my head, all the way to my mid-thigh) I went into a state of shock, apparently screaming my head off.  The plaster was cold, it made me absolutely claustrophobic and I thought I was going to die. They finally had to put me in a private room so others wouldn't be disturbed by my carrying on. I screamed and cried for days.  One afternoon a resident came in and sat down. He held my hand and started talking to me about a recent hiking trip he had taken in NC. And as he talked, I was able to calm down. I will never forget him and his calm storytelling. He taught me compassion and taking time with patients.</li>

    	<li>I had a nurse named Kaye Butcher whom I will never forget. And if I could find her, she would be in her 70's now, I would hug her to pieces. Patients  were in the hospital so long that everyone wore their own clothes - no hospital gowns pre-surgery. Without ever asking, she took my things home weekly and washed them. She also brought me treats. One time she tried to serve me cream of wheat thinking it was grits and thought I was missing them from back home!  I remember she had long black hair and she reminded me of Karen Carpenter. She taught me the gift of helping.</li>

    	<li>Our home in NC was not air conditioned. Somehow after Mom did some calling around to get pricing, an owner of a company and his crew ended up putting in central air for free. They worked in the evenings and  weekends on their own time and the house was cool by the time I arrived in late summer. God bless them. I have no idea who they were. These men taught me how angels, again, come in all shapes and sizes. That AC worked without repair for 30+ years. A heavenly miracle.</li>

    	<li>I was alone that summer when I was bedbound and  learned to entertain myself. My friends were all busy with swimming and tennis. And the days were long.  I learned to watch life on the sidelines that summer and I think it taught me how to do it again now.</li>

    	<li>I will never forget though one friend, not a close friend by any means and she didn't live in my neighborhood, but in she walked one summer afternoon with a deck of cards and played with me all afternoon. I doubt she remembers it but I will never forget it. She taught me that the smallest action can have powerful impact on those around you. And that impact can last a lifetime.</li>

    </ul>

    <em>All's to say</em>, 1974-75 must have been spring training season for the big leagues of which I feel I am now playing.  Though I couldn't imagine it then, I feel well-prepared for what's ahead.</p>

    <h2>Ramblings with Momma</h2>
    <h2>January 27th, 2015</h2>

    <p>I woke up yesterday and was supposed to  have my PET scan but as many of you know, it is snowing to beat the band and though I love her, Helga goes nowhere in the snow except toward a ditch so I cancelled my scan and it is now scheduled for Wednesday.  As I was posting the blog about scoliosis Mom called. We have coffee 'together' a couple of times a week over the phone. So while she sipped, I read the blog to her as she likes me to do and then somehow we got on to Pintrest. She has hundreds of followers and scores of pages.

    Well, let me back up. She and I are quite similar in our tastes of most things. Where we veer off is minor, sometimes clothing, always politics and religion (ha) but I digress. Remember I love that red door (as does she) but she also has that vein of artsy that I don't have when it comes to clothing....yet when it comes to interior design, centerpieces for tables, things that catch her eye, we are scarily similar. We have given each other the same birthday card several times over the years.

    So, the other day I was looking through a website of quotes. And I came upon this:

    [caption id="attachment_1628" align="aligncenter" width="500"]<a href="http://www.sherrifillipo.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/freedom.jpg"><img class="wp-image-1628" src="http://www.sherrifillipo.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/freedom.jpg" alt="logodesignlove.com" width="500" height="300" /></a> logodesignlove.com[/caption]

    I can't tell you how I felt when I saw it. Unlike what you see here, the quote was on a pale blue background that looked like the sky with that 'm' of a bird flying off toward heaven. So while we were on Pintrest this morning looking at seaglass she had me go to her 'just because' page and there staring back at me was this quote! It makes me crazy every time this happens and it happens often (but I kind of like it too). The quote was tattooed on the inner aspect of a woman's wrist. I had planned to show the quote to Mom because I thought it was so clever. Apparently so did she.

    Then we moved on to dinner. I was lamenting now that the PET scan had been postponed, I was going into the kitchen to find some bread to eat when she told me she needed to go to the store to get a loaf herself. She had cooked a roast yesterday and they were having sandwiches tonight. "You know you can never find a rump roast anymore...." she said. Since I am never looking for a roast,  I asked, "Why?" Wouldn't you know, she said, "Well, I asked the butcher the same thing the other day. And you know what he said? Lady, a cow only has one rump." We died laughing. We decided we didn't know that rumps were quite so rare.

    On Saturday she facetimed  me as she and my dad had gone on a 'field trip' as they call them. I guess once a teacher, always a teacher. She wanted to show me some 'beautiful rocks' that they intended to place along the bank of their creek. I smiled and ohhed and ahhed. (She, knowing full well, that the only rocks I think are beautiful are the ones that  come in that robins' egg blue box tied with that pretty white ribbon.)

    Maybe we are different in more ways than I thought....naw, any 70 something that thinks <em>Breaking Bad</em> is one of the best shows she has ever watched and gets the humor of <em>Portlandia</em> is a lot like me...or I her...

    I also warned her today that anything she says can and will be used against her in my blog. I warned her that she might become a weekly spotlight. She wasn't phased.</p>

    <h2>My PET Scan Man</h2>
    <h3>January 29th, 2015</h3>

    <p><h3>Wednesday Morning</h3>

    Over the river and through the woods I went today for my re-scheduled PET scan. I adore "Stan, My PET Scan Man" as I call him. As much as I hate to sit in the waiting room and complete paperwork EVERY time I have a scan (do you have a port? <em>duh</em> any medical clips? <em>duh</em> do you have cancer?<em> duh</em> have you had any surgeries? <em>duh</em>). Over and over again but I do it because once I have told them the same thing for the hundredth time, my pet scan man bursts into the waiting room and asks, "Has the old man updated your ipad yet?" In front of a packed crowd, every time. Official patient identification? Forget about it. He thinks he is funny and he is, actually. A tall, big man that always gives me a bear hug when the scan is completed. When he blew through again today and  saw my mini ipad he bellowed, "Well, I'm glad he finally took my advice!" And part of me thinks he really believes I should thank him for making my Christmas present a reality!

    So we do our routine: we walk down the hall; he stops at the bathroom (so, as my mother says before any outing, I can 'squeeze three drops out') and then we walk down the ramp out onto the dock that takes us to the truck so I can become radioactive. Today we got stopped on our routine by the CEO out on the dock (8 degrees at noon, just sayin') while he introduced me to a new hospital leader and there PET scan man and I stood freezing but when the top guy stops and wants to chat, you chat. So when he introduced me, I said, "Yes, my husband works here; I'm doing my  part here to keep up volumes (if you are in healthcare you know exactly what I mean) and then we parted and off we went onto the truck.

    PET man turned to me and asked, "Why are you back so soon? What's going on?" When I told him I was considering stopping treatment but Dr. xxx wanted a scan in case I started one of the two new chemos so we would have a baseline, he just stood there and stared at me for a moment. So odd but I am getting used to my healthcare providers slipping over that healthcare worker - patient relationship and becoming friend-friend. "What?" I explained it the best I could while he jabbed me with the IV (did he stick me just a little harder this time?? :-)  We talked on but as I got on the table for the scan, he looked down at me and said, "You do know I understand but sometimes it is so hard when you get close to patients." Hmmmmm, where I have heard that before SABRINA?  Am I going to eventually scare the entire workforce away from my hospital??

    We got through the scan - got back on board with our routine, those same gluten-free cookies, the bear hug and the good-bye. He put me on the truck lift and said, "I will see you soon." I said yes though I am not sure.

    <h3>Wednesday Evening</h3>

    My oncologist phoned around 6:00pm to tell me that the two liver lesions that were showing such activity have apparently been slowed down by the past two chemo treatments. One lesion is so small that they didn't assign it an uptake number (before it was 7 then up to 13 now down to ??) and the second one went from 7 to 13 down to 7.6 (7.6? how do they determine .6??) So, though I was at a birthday dinner at the time, I told her I would think and pray about it and see her next week. She pleaded with me to think about a "marked reduction" in the chemo that made me so so wiped out before. I told her I would think and pray about it.

    <h3>Thursday Afternoon</h3>

    I continue to think about it. Beloved and I have not had a chance yet to discuss it. I am leaning toward a miniscule dose to see how my body reacts all the while wondering what per cent of the original dosage is actually needed to make a difference. Do you get what I mean? And we won't know for a while. I do know if it takes the original dosage to keep everything in check, I won't be onboard with that. Again, as I have said before there is so much we do not know about this field. But then again, isn't all of life such a mystery? That's why another of my favorite verses is that "we walk by faith, not by sight."</p>

    <h2>Contentment in Life</h2>
    <h3>January 30th, 2015</h3>

    <p>I learned a new word today: wabi-sabi. My son sent me a text with a list of twenty words we don't have an adequate translation for in English. And this was one of them. A Japanese word, it means (to the best of one's ability to define an undefinable word; that irony is not lost on me!) peace living in a world with all its imperfections accepting decay as a natural cycle in everything including the body.

    As I continued to research this odd word, I came upon a website   <span style="color: #008080;"><a style="color: #008080;" title="wabi-sabi" href="http://nobleharbor.com/tea/chado/WhatIsWabi-Sabi.htm" target="_blank">http://nobleharbor.com/tea/chado/WhatIsWabi-Sabi.htm  </a></span>that went on at length about the concept. I loved this one sentence:

    <blockquote><span style="font-family: Arial;">It's simple, slow, and uncluttered-and it reveres authenticity above all. Wabi-sabi is flea markets, not warehouse stores; aged wood, not Pergo; rice paper, not glass. It celebrates cracks and crevices and all the other marks that time, weather, and loving use leave behind. It reminds us that we are all but transient beings on this planet-that our bodies as well as the material world around us are in the process of returning to the dust from which we came. Through wabi-sabi, we learn to embrace liver spots, rust, and frayed edges, and the march of time they represent.</span></blockquote>

    <p style="text-align: left;">From what I can understand <em>wabi</em> is the imperfect perfection described in one article as the flaw in a piece of ceramic whereas the <em>sabi</em> is the beauty that comes with aging  - with patina. I am sure I am doing a great disservice to those who really understand this concept but it really spoke to me as I watch my body decline both due to age overlapped with the decaying from the cancer. That double word gave me a little lift like, "Hey cancer, liver spots and all: I am wabi-sabi, old enough I have a little patina on me."</p>

    <p style="text-align: left;">I don't know. Then sometimes, I am at the point where I do not like to look at myself in the mirror. I had my hair cut and colored today and loathe when Dustin makes me look at his handiwork in the mirror. Though I love how he styles my hair, I hate the way my face frames it. I even blurted out today, "You know. I wasn't always 54." I mean, how brilliant a statement was that? He just looked down at me with those big blue eyes and said, "Miss Sherri. You look great." Humph. Wabi-sabi to you, I thought.</p></p>

    <h2>Gone to Carolina</h2>
    <h3>February 2nd, 2015</h3>

    <p>Wow. On Friday I flew to Raleigh, NC to visit Mom and Dad, then sidekick Aunt  and cousin Anne showed up on Saturday morning we five jumped into Dad's BIG truck (Daddy said it was like driving four Miss Daisies)  and off we went to South Carolina to celebrate my great uncle's 90th birthday!   His son and family flew in from Colorado, folks from everywhere including a dear friend of his from church all landed at a restaurant, about 28 of us in all. My uncle is still quite dapper at 90 and still has a mischievous gleam in his eye.  He is the cutie pie on the left although take a look at the photo. They are both adorable don't you think?   I think if we had been contemporaries we could have gotten in a lot of trouble together!

    Because it is <em>Momma Monday</em> and I am still here in Raleigh, although I wrote this last night, she woke up this morning wanting to edit my blog (I told her to get her own blog but she quickly reminded me that my audience wanted to hear more from her!) My uncle served in WWII on the <em>USS Hornet</em> in the South Pacific. And though a handsome young buck, my mother says he carried a "little tiny picture" of her during his entire deployment. Think Shirley Temple.

    He calls me Sherri Lynn and though it is indeed my middle name, no one and I mean no one has ever called me that except him. And to be frank, I don't think I would let anyone else call me that! He has been a widower for many years, still lives on a golf course and see friends regularly. And every few weeks, he will call. I can never remember the area code but as soon as I say hello, he will say, "Sherri Lynn? This is your Uncle Howard." And we gibber jabber for about a half hour.

    At the party Saturday, night, my cousin had made a family favorite cake, mocha, that my great grandmother used to make! (I think it must have been exotic back in the day, don't you?) And my mom had a red, white and blue, sheet cake made with the above picture of him with his Navy buddy smiling broadly at the camera both with their lives ahead of them. You should have seen him smile when he saw that picture. Though it took him a while, he came up with the name of his WWII buddy. We 'googled' him but to no one's surprise he was no longer with us.

    The private dining room held another party of about the same size. We couldn't tell what the occasion was as there were no balloons, nothing to denote anything special though they seemed to be happy to be there. When it was time to have our cake and to sing Happy Birthday, we went over to their section, interrupted their dinner and asked if they would join us in a song to our uncle. They more than obliged and I bet 50+ people belted out the song. Uncle Howard stood there hardly able to take it all in. When Mom showed the other party  the 'military cake' everyone clapped and an older gentleman in the back stood up, saluted my uncle and said, "Thank you for your service sir." It was absolutely magical.

    Momma is sitting behind me as  I write. She says I put too many 'ands' in my writing and if I were in the third grade and living in NC and it was time to take the standardized test and it was time to take it today, I would fail. Good thing for many reasons I don't live in NC and can choose if and when I come to visit.

    &nbsp;

    Addendum: Besides my affinity for too many ands, she just asked me if I knew to place two spaces after a sentence...............................</p>

  <h2>Miscellaneous Ramblings from North Carolina</h2>
  <h3>February 3rd, 2015</h3>
  <p>Today is my last day in NC.  Mom and I have binge-watched <em>Mad Men</em> while I have been here. I wanted to get her 'addicted' to it as she was to <em>Breaking Bad</em>.  I think I have succeeded.  She now has me obsessed with making sure I double space after a sentence.  If you notice I have not been doing it, please forgive me and look the other way...remember when I told you we have many similarities?  Well, as I have walked around her house the past two days, I keep shaking my head. Like my apartment, she has bird nests everywhere. I forgot she finds them as fascinating as I do. I mean real nests, not from a store.  I had to convince Beloved a couple of years ago that we wouldn't get any bird borne diseases. So, far so good - unless they cause breast cancer and in that case no wonder I got a double dose.  Ha. I don't think I like double spacing.

  When I read Friday's blog to my mom, aunt and cousin - the one about wabi-sabi, I had just started reading when my mom piped up, "Oh! Wabi-sabi. I have that on my  Pintrest account." Of course you do, I thought and kept reading but my aunt and cousin kept saying, "Wabi who?  I though that was the hot green stuff you put on sushi..." But Momma kept saying, "Oh no! It's all about the beauty in the world....life cycles...beauty in the wear and tear of life......." Of course she knew all about it. Why would I be surprised?

  After her backseat editing from yesterday's blog I invited her to be a "user" which in the blog world could give her writing/editorial rights to my blog. I told her Mondays could be hers and hers alone to write about whatever her heart desired.  No, she wouldn't take me up on that. Not sure why as she did a splendid job of sitting behind me today and being my 3rd grade writing teacher!

  We have had a good time. She is a good sport about so many things. Nothing gets her too upset - well some things do but I will restrain myself from revealing them lest I get her started. On a final note, I have been asking to have a hedgehog for a pet. Really. I think they are the cutest things in the world. They are quite prolific in my sister-in-law's country of Belgium. I want her to bring one back. I was happy to discover that Mom didn't know how cute and popular they are. She really didn't believe it until she had confirmed it with Pintrest! </p>

    <h2>Hidden Magic Everywhere</h2>
    <h3>February 4th, 2015</h3>
    <p>What a day I had yesterday, my last day in NC and then an evening flight back to 9 degrees and 10 inches of snow on the ground. I am convinced as I continue to look around that there are amazing things all around me (us) in the most unsuspected places. I wish I had learned that sooner in life. Last night I was on the shuttle bus in Philly going from one of the large terminals to Terminal F where all the small commuter planes fly out of taking us to small places further north and into towns tucked in the hills of NY, PA and beyond. I was sitting on the bus when an elderly woman sat down beside me. She noticed I was playing <em>Words with Friends</em> and asked me what that game was. When I told her, she said she would have to look that one up. She then started really talking. (And mind you this is at most a 5-10 ride across the tarmac). Come to find out, she worked for the Census Bureau for many years and somehow was in charge of listing/keeping track of the streets in the United States. A large and commanding woman she looked down at me over her glasses and said, "Would you live on Psycho Place?" I thought, "No, not if I want to keep flying I wouldn't." Yes, she said that it exists out in Arizona I think she told me. "How about Toxic Waste Dump Road? I am not kidding. And she named the state where that unfortunate neighborhood lives and I suppose tries to rise above it. I asked if she could imagine trying to sell property listed at that address and she just chuckled. She then said, "I have one more for you. And it's subtle. The name of the street is Every Road. Doesn't sound like much does it until you give someone directions. It apparently is off a highway - I will just make the number up. So, once you exit Highway 15, turn left on Every Road." And she laughed and laughed.

    After I gotten an education from her I found my gate and waited a half hour. Then a young woman with a one year old and three-year old, a stroller and three pieces of soft luggage walked up. I looked over at her and wondered how in the world she was going to manage to handle all of that. By this time it was 8:30pm and I just looked at her. That stroller was bigger than my first car. And she was a petite little thing. I walked over to her and asked if  I could help her get everything on the plane and she seemed grateful (how could you not be?) Come to find out they had been travelling from San Francisco all day. I wanted to collapse just from the sound of it. We struck up a conversation. She grew up in the town next to Corning but they have been on the west coast for quite a while. Her husband is being considered for a position in Corning and she had come home to visit family and see if a move back might work. I asked her if her boys had ever seen snow. She thought the older one had but wouldn't remember it and the younger one definitely had not.

    We all got on the plane and while waiting, the little boy started talking to the moon. "Come on down here Godzilla where I can see you good. Move your head in the moon and come on down here. Godzilla, do you hear me? Move your head so I get to you." With an adorable lisp, he continued to talk to the moon; everyone on the plane was laughing so hard we were crying. When the plan started taxiing, he said, "Now you're moving your head. I am going to get you."

    When we deplaned in Elmira, the older boy held my hand while Momma wrestled with the younger boy and the stroller. I looked down at the boy and his eyes were chocolate saucers. He was staring at the snow piled up around the tarmac. His mother says he calls snow "white sand" so we went over to a clean pile and I scooped up some and asked him if he wanted to touch it. He held out his little hand and was startled by the sensation. He looked up at me, mouth agape.

    They walked in the terminal and found her parents. I walked in and found my Beloved. He took me home and though exhausted, I sat down and thought how could I have imagined meeting the people that I did and being given the honor of placing the first snowball into the hands of a child?</p>

    <h2>When It Comes to Breast Cancer, Hope and Pink Ribbons Are  Not A Strategy For Cure</h2>
    <h3>February 5th, 2015</h3>

    The article below was published in <em>USA Today</em> on Tuesday. The title of the article? <em>Breast cancer deaths drop dramatically over 20 years</em></span>

<span style="color: #008080;">If you have been following along with me over the past few months, you will know that what you read below is not completely accurate. Sadly for the 155,000 in the US living with metastatic cancer, it grieves us so to see a national publication send this across the nation when so much of it is skewed. In this article you will read:</span>

<span style="color: #008080;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Article:</span></strong> <span style="color: #000000;">Early detection saves lives and mammograms are one of the leading reasons in this decline.</span> </span>

<span style="color: #008080;"><strong>My response:</strong> </span><span style="color: #008080;"> Not necessarily true; mammograms cannot tell us which breast cancers will need treatment no matter how early or how often you receive a mammogram; Remember what Dr. Susan Love, surgeon and breast cancer expert said about mammograms recently? "Mammography is capable of finding about 26% of cancers at a point where it makes a life-saving difference in the outcome,<strong> it also finds many lesions which would never have gone on to be life-threatening and others which will still be life-threatening in spite of early detection and rigorous screening.</strong>"</span>

<span style="color: #008080;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Article:</strong> Women are celebrating living longer.</span> </span>

<span style="color: #008080;"><strong>My response:</strong> M</span><span style="color: #008080;">aybe they did not have metastatic disease and were never going to die from it to begin with; but  44,000 will die every year from this disease.</span>

<span style="color: #008080;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Article:</strong> There is a lot of anecdotal 'evidence' of survivorship.</span></span>

<span style="color: #008080;"><strong>My response:</strong>  When you read articles or books you will note a lot of individual storytelling of people living longer lives; the median length of survivorship of someone with metastatic disease is still three years and that hasn't moved significantly in decades.</span>

<span style="color: #008080;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Article:</strong> One reason that for the decrease is that we, as women, are "paying more attention to our bodies."</span>  </span>

<span style="color: #008080;"><strong>My response:</strong>  I paid great attention to my body and never missed a mammogram and I am dying from this disease. Do you see how crazy articles can be?</span>

<span style="color: #008080;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Article:</strong> We are told in the article to view the long-term, downward trend "optimistically and with hope from the day they hear, 'You have breast cancer.' "</span> </span>

<span style="color: #008080;"><strong>My response:</strong> You can hope all you want but it is not a strategy or an immunization against what is going on inside your body.  You may have a disease that is localized inside your breast and therefore you will NOT die from breast cancer. If your cancer starts to travel and it lands in the most common organs: liver, lungs, bone, brain you WILL die from the disease. </span><span style="color: #008080;">Remember only 7% of the 15 billion dollars allocated for breast cancer research over the last decade has gone toward finding a cure for those of us in which the disease has  spread. No amount of hope or pink ribbons is going to determine why my cancer flew on to my liver and is microscopically circulating in my body waiting to attack another organ</span>.

<strong>From USA Today:</strong>

Breast cancer deaths have dropped dramatically in the past two decades — the result of better treatment, greater awareness and more women getting mammograms.

The latest government statistics show deaths declined 34% between 1990 and 2011, from 33 to 22 per 100,000 women, and experts expect that the downward trend has continued in the four years since. The American Cancer Society says this translates into more than 200,000 deaths averted.

<div class="clearfix">Megan Schanie is among the growing ranks of survivors. After a breast cancer diagnosis in 2006, Schanie feared she might not live to see her two children grow up. But on Sunday, she celebrated her youngest daughter's 10th birthday.</div>

"It's fantastic," says Schanie, 39, who helped start a support group for young breast cancer survivors in her hometown of Louisville. "Even in my own little world, I've noticed that we have so many in our group who are surviving."

<div class="clearfix"></div>

<div class="clearfix">Otis Brawley, chief medical officer for the cancer society, which is marking World Cancer Day on Wednesday, says the biggest reason is that treatments have improved, with new medicines such as targeted chemotherapy and the estrogen blocker Tamoxifen.</div>

</div>

Meanwhile, Brawley says, awareness of the disease has risen steadily, and women now go to their doctors when something seems awry. Mammogram screenings are the third-most-important reason for the decline in deaths, he says; mammography rates among U.S. women 40 and older have risen from 29% in 1987 to 67% in the 2005-10 period.

"In the 1990s, there was this huge push to screen women with mammography, to reach women who didn't have access," says Thomas Tucker, director of the Kentucky Cancer Registry.

<p class="oembed-link-title"><em>Mayo Clinic plans trials for breast cancer vaccine</em></p>

<div> Cancer society statistics show mammography rates have leveled off in recent years, dropping slightly from 70% in 2000. Complicating matters, there are currently two different, high-profile recommendations regarding mammograms: The cancer society endorses yearly screening starting at age 40, while the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force advises screening every two years for women ages 50-74.</div>

</div>

</div>

</div>

Breast cancer experts say they aren't sure how these conflicting recommendations will affect death rates. But they expect continuing advances in breast cancer treatment. Susan Brown, managing director of health and mission program education for Susan G. Komen, the breast cancer organization, says there's a trend toward more targeted, individualized therapies as scientists learn more about the biology of tumors. And treatments will get only more personalized in the future, she says.

</div>

</div>

Schanie says she appreciates such advances. She's also glad breast cancer is no longer shrouded in secrecy as it was in decades past, and that women are paying more attention to their bodies than ever before. In her case, she woke one morning to find her right breast swollen, with a hardened area, and a biopsy confirmed cancer. She had a double mastectomy and chemotherapy and later took Tamoxifen pills and underwent breast reconstruction. She's had no signs of cancer since.

Going forward, Brawley says the breast cancer death rate may not keep dropping as quickly as it has, partly because some of the most difficult-to-treat types of cancer remain. Still, he says, "I'm very hopeful we'll continue to have a decline."

Brown says women should view the long-term, downward trend "optimistically and with hope from the day they hear, 'You have breast cancer.' </p>

<h2>One Doesn't Have to be Old to Fall, Just Ask Me or Atul Gawande</h2>
<h3> February 6th, 2015</h3>

<p>I was having a pretty uneventful day yesterday. Beloved was out of town on business. It was cold and I was still recuperating from all of my family festivities when I called Mom last evening to talk. We chatted about the party, about a recipe she had sent me and then I told her I had been reading the book that both she and a family friend had recommended by Atul Gawande,  <em>On Being Mortal: Medicine and What Matters in the End</em>. I was waxing on about how the book, for the most part, seemed to be written for older people who were staring down the barrel of old age, nursing homes etc. not for younger and middle-aged people like me who had diseases that would not get us to that point. Mom and I were talking back and forth about it, she didn't necessarily agree with me. I then told her I had no idea what I would write about for Friday's blog and asked her to say something funny so I would have some fodder to write about. She politely declined.  We continued to talk on a few minutes  and then hung up.



I padded around in my pajamas, watched the news. Beloved called and checked in. I watched a little more television until I was ready to call it a day. I don't do this when Beloved is here but when I am alone, I have a few OCD tendencies and I went to check on the patio door. Mind you that we live on the top floor and only my neighbor who has a terrace up there as well could get to me and why should she want to? She left me cupcakes yesterday by the door, hoping that I was weathering this cold weather. There is also a foot of snow on the terrace that all but covers all the furniture leaving them looking like large white mounds. Who could or would want to get me?  But nevertheless I climbed three little steps to check the lock and fell face forward on to a wicker box that we keep the cat food in and then face down on the floor. I saw stars like I have never seen in the sky, stood up and realized I had cut my upper eyelid.

<h2>After the Fall</h2>

When the thin blood started to pour (chemo changes everything) it looked like I had made some strange sacrifice out on the terrace. It was enough that I suddenly felt old, vulnerable, scared and alone.  I thought about the book that I  had just poo-pooed a couple of hours ago and thought, "Serves you right, you little smarty pants."



I called the first person I could think of - that "brother" of mine that I have spoken about before. Though he teases me mercilessly (he might tell you that that street runs both ways) he picked up the phone quickly and thought I had called to rib him about something. When he heard me crying and when I could get out that Beloved was not here, I heard him say he was on his way and the phone clicked.



He arrived within minutes bearing surgical scissors, steri-strips, and flashlight. No joking around. He got right to work. He cleaned my wound as gently as any nurse, did an assessment on me. Did I ever tell you he is a physician? He doesn't want to be named here either so I will call him <em>Little Brother</em>. He checked my pupils, compared one side of my face to the other, told me it looked a little swollen and applied the steri-strips. He then told me to sit up for a while and keep a cold compress on my eye.



Then the little brother kicked in. We have a Valentine's Ball to attend Saturday night, a fundraiser for our local hospital. The theme this year is Mardi Gras. As he was walking out after making sure I was ok, he suggested I might want to find a masquerade  mask for the evening so I could hide my swollen eye. Ha. Ha.

<h2>This Morning</h2>

This morning I woke up and texted him to tell him I was alright and to  thank him for coming out in 0 degree weather. Simultaneously, he was emailing me with this message: How are you today? Along with this picture:</p>

    <h2>Falling: It's Not Just For the Elderly Anymore</h2>

    <p>I am doing fine after my Thursday night trip up the steps. I am sporting a bit of magenta around the eye and a heavy eyelid but nothing that time won't heal - unlike other things going on in my body. I ended up not needing a masquerade mask Saturday evening. By the  time I should have been trying to either camouflage the black eye or somehow coordinate the eye shadow with my non-black eye, I just didn't think I could go out to the ball. Beloved still quite sick (and he NEVER gets sick) between the two of us, we would have brought the mood down at our table so we just stayed in.</p>

This topic may bore you to tears unless you work in healthcare or can appreciate that falling could happen to anyone. What I am trying to say again is that one's risk for falling is not limited to those in nursing homes. There are many people out there in the world who have actually dedicated their lives to understanding the causation of falls, the most noted person from the Yale School of Public Health, Dr. Mary Tinetti. An excellent resource for anyone is her Fall Prevention website:  <a title="Fall Prevention" href="http://www.fallprevention.org/pages/abs_art.htm" target="_blank">http://www.fallprevention.org/pages/abs_art.htm</a>

Every hospital in America has what is called a "falls program" with a committee of various members whose goal it is to reduce the number of falls with injury. And as I have moved through now four very different hospital organizations in my career,  I have been a part of falls teams on each and it amazes me how little many healthcare givers understand about falls and risk reduction.

In Atul Gawande's latest book that I referenced on Friday, <em>Being Mortal: Medicine and What Matters in the End</em>,  he states the three primary risk factors for falling:

<ol>

	<li>poor balance</li>

	<li>taking more than four prescriptions</li>

	<li>muscle weakness</li>

</ol>

He states that elderly people without these risk factors have a 12% chance of falling in a year. Those with all three risk factors have almost a 100% chance. I will expand on what he has written and remind those of you who do not know me that I am middle-aged, not elderly and I have all three risk factors and guess what? Down I went. And regretfully, it was not the first time and scarily probably won't be my last.

[pullquote]Elderly people without these risk factors have a 12% chance of falling in a year. Those with all three risk factors have almost a 100% chance.[/pullquote]

If you are reading this and you wonder what it has got to do with you, it may not have anything to do with you. But what about your parents? Older siblings? If you are in healthcare, it definitely means everything to you even if you are not caring for the elderly. How so?  Once an individual enters the doors of a hospital, it is my opinion and those of many others they <strong>all </strong>become fall risks. Why?

<ul>

	<li>Patients are placed in unfamiliar settings (a hospital room or exam room)</li>

	<li>At night, they are less likely to remember they are not at home and get disoriented</li>

	<li>Hospitals may or may not have night lights in the rooms or bathrooms; unlit, unfamiliar surroundings and down they go</li>

	<li>Patients are likely given medications that they were not taking at home or adding medications to their home regimen; see Gawande's #2 risk factor above.</li>

	<li>Patients will likely be under increased stress from being in the hospital and/or there without family and friends. They may attempt to try and do more independently (toileting, getting a shower, leaning over and getting water) and fall out of the bed or a chair.</li>

	<li>Hospitals may believe they provide hourly rounding for their patients but I have found time and time again that many healthcare leaders don't really even know what constitutes the make-up of an hourly round</li>

</ul>

I know I am on a soap box (and I will be careful when I step down!)  but I think everyone needs to take an updated perspective on falls and falling. Young and old alike, based on what we are doing, where we have been, it can all add up to a trip and a fall in a heartbeat. If I weren't so vain, I would take a selfie and show you what three small steps did to me! </p>

    <h2>Help Before You Fall</h2>
    <h3>February 10th, 2015</h3>

    <p>I should have known but it still caught me off guard, the number of you all who texted, emailed or commented here on the blog about the many various ways you have fallen in the past - including some very recent incidents! Falls are much more common than we would like to believe. Though I had no intention of writing once about the topic never mind a third time, I thought I would end this topic with giving you some preventions that you could check off at your home and/or the home of your loved ones.  In Dr. Tinetti's website on falls prevention, she lists the most common causes of falls. I have indicated them below with my ideas for prevention (with all due apology to Dr. Tinetti who may or may not agree with me and probably has many more that I have never thought of):

    <h2>The common health problems for falling are:</h2>

    <ol>

    	<li><strong>Problems walking or moving around</strong>

    <ol>

    	<li>Do you have difficulty when you go shopping? Can you navigate through stores?</li>

    	<li>Do you have difficulty walking if you have to park far away from the store? Do you need to apply for a handicapped parking sticker?</li>

    </ol>

    </li>

    	<li><strong>Four or more medications</strong>

    <ol>

    	<li>If you see more than one physician, does each caregiver know what you are taking, in totality?</li>

    	<li>If you go to the Emergency Room or are admitted, do you know everything you are taking? Do you have a list and can you provide it to your caregiver?</li>

    	<li>You will hear the term "medication reconciliation" spoken in hospitals and doctors' offices and that is the nearly impossible task of keeping up with your meds, any changes in dosages, any new or discontinued items. While so important, we as a nation have realized how awesomely difficult the task is - can  you/your family member help the caregiver by providing updated information every time you are seen? There a lots of templates online that you can complete and take with you.</li>

    </ol>

    </li>

    	<li><strong>Foot problems, unsafe footwear</strong>

    <ol>

    	<li>That would be me last week. I was wearing scuffs, no backing on my shoe and a little worn, enough that I did a slide up the steps.</li>

    	<li>If you have diabetes, you know your fingers and toes can and do go numb, known as neuropathy, this is a definite factor in trips and falls. Your feet have decreased sensation and if not careful, you could be headed downward; and not just diabetes, chemotherapeutic agents can cause the same numbing.</li>

    	<li>Untied shoes, tripping on laces</li>

    	<li>Shoes that simply don't fit.</li>

    	<li>High heels, clogs, think of what we put our feet through and expect them to get us from here to there without incident!</li>

    </ol>

    </li>

    	<li><strong>Blood pressure drops too much on standing up/dizzy</strong>

    <ol>

    	<li>Link this problem with #2 and you can see how medications (or polypharmacy as it is called in healthcare) can be overwhelmingly causative of falls; if your healthcare providers don't know what you are taking, the mixing of medications can cause all kinds of untoward side effects, blood pressure drops being just one</li>

    </ol>

    </li>

    	<li><strong>Problems with seeing</strong>

    <ol>

    	<li>Sounds pretty obvious but if you wear glasses, when was the last time you had your eyes checked?</li>

    	<li>Is your driveway well lit not only for you but for guests?</li>

    	<li>How about your porch? Is the light working? Is it bright enough? Basement lights working?</li>

    	<li>Do you have handrails outside at your steps? How about sturdy handrails going down to your basement?</li>

    	<li>Silly, but is your hair in your eyes? Do you need a haircut?</li>

    	<li>Do you have nightlights throughout your home? If you are a night time snacker, is your pathway lit for your late night feasts?</li>

    </ol>

    </li>

    	<li><strong>Tripping hazards in your home</strong>

    <ol>

    	<li>Do you need to rearrange furniture to allow better maneuvering through your living space?</li>

    	<li>Are there too many items on the floor (decorative or otherwise) that could cause you to trip?</li>

    	<li>Do you have a pet or two who may circle through your feet and potentially cause you to stumble?</li>

    	<li>Do you have slick magazines lying around waiting on you to slide on them?</li>

    	<li>Are spills from humans or pets cleaned up as soon as they happen?</li>

    </ol>

    </li>

    </ol>

    I think you have gotten the point. For those who are caring for or who are checking in on older loved ones, you may get their attention and assistance with these hints above if they know that for those over 70, 16% of all Emergency Department visits are due to falls and fall-related injuries. Keeping healthy is difficult enough; some things are just not within our control to change (like cancer!); others we can at least help mitigate. I hope you find this helpful.

    Mom says it's time for less technical stuff. I will see what I can do for tomorrow.</p>

    <h2>A Chance Encounter with a Purple Horse: Happy Anniversary Mom & Dad</h2>
    <h3>Februrary 11th, 2015</h3>

    <p>My mother left me a message last night saying she had meant to call earlier  but had gotten tied up with running errands all day. Then she reminded me that it was her wedding anniversary and that they were staying in and dining on shrimp cocktail...I suddenly had a flashback from a year or so ago. We were at a family gathering and had walked out onto the sidewalk (Mom, Dad and I). Mom, in usual fashion, had left something back in the restaurant and we waited while she retrieved whatever it was. Dad was slowly headed back her way when I stopped in the entryway of an art gallery and was looking at a rather large painting of a purple horse. Yes, I know what you are thinking and no I was not drunk. It really was a very large painting.  I looked up and a homeless man who was farther along in his liquid celebration than I, looked at me and asked, "What is that thing?" I stood there thinking, "Oh this is going to go over <strong><em>so</em></strong> well.....It's a purple horse."

    "No it ain't," he bellowed! "Don't you know a raging bull when you see one?" Never one to argue with a drunk person, I acquiesced but he could tell I was just pandering. "Cain't you see his raging nose? His horns? Don't you see it?" At just that moment Mom and Dad walked up, looked over at the two of us, smiled and kept walking. The homeless fellow yelled out to Mom, "Hey! Don't be mad at your husband. Come on. Forgive him. Fifty years of marriage. You gotta forgive him" And the two of us started following them. We passed by two young men who were seated at a table outside and I heard one of them say, "Oh this is going to get interesting." But those guys didn't  budge.

    As the fellow and I walked behind Mom and Dad my new friend remarked, "Andy and Aunt Bea. Don't they make the loveliest couple?" "Couple?" I said loudly enough for Mom and Dad to hear me. "Fifty years? Those two old hippies finally made me legitimate last year."  I thought my new homeless friend was going to have to sit down on the sidewalk to compose himself he laughed so hard.

    We finally stopped at an intersection and he got in front of Mom and Dad, made his hands into L-shapes to mimic a television screen and said, "Andy and Aunt Bea...Aunt Bea and Andy...a fine couple" and out he walked into traffic until Mom pulled him back on the curb. The light changed at that moment. We walked straight ahead and he turned right, walking down the street, shaking his head and laughing, "What a cute couple."</p>

    <h2>The Conversation</h2>
    <h3>February 12th, 2015</h3>

    <p>If you were to ask me what is the most difficult thing I deal with, I would tell you it is letting me talk about death and dying - what I do and do not want to occur both on this side of life and what I want you to do when I am on the other. If you know me, you know that I couch a lot of things in the cloak of humor because as they say, "just a spoon full of sugar helps the medicine go down.." and it's true.  In a very southern way when I say something to my mother and it creeps up on the edge of death, she will say, "if you don't shut up, I am going to smack you." Don't be alarmed. That is a <em>very</em>  southern thing to say, no matter how old the child is. But it is her way of saying, "I can't talk about that or I don't want to talk about that or talk to someone else about that..." And I get it. I really do.

    I was perusing through the New York Times this morning and came upon one of their "most emailed stories." If you don't read the NYT, every day they will list the top ten stories at the moment that readers are emailing to family and friends. The topics vary widely and I do get a kick of what is making the rounds. It could be anything from Obamacare to some strange recipe for artichokes. You never know. But one of the top stories today was about a woman who had recently died and the title of the article was <a title="Seeking a Beautiful Death" href="http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/02/09/know-the-hard-choices-prolonging-life-entails/?smprod=nytcore-ipad&amp;smid=nytcore-ipad-share" target="_blank"><em>Seeking a Beautiful Death </em></a>by Jane Brody.

    In it, the author quotes Dr. Angelo E. Volandes,  author of a new book, <em>The Conversation. </em> A lot like the book I have been quoting by Atul Gawande (<em>Being Mortal</em>) the author says as Americans we have access to the best medical care in the world yet we often die some of the worst deaths in the world. Why?  Because we do not  have the "conversation" that would outline what we do and do not want at the end of our lives. I am not talking about those of us with terminal illnesses. I mean, as do these authors, <strong>all of us</strong> whether young or old, sick or well.

    The list of questions that Dr. Volandes made (and that Ms. Brody used in her article)  is so spot-on that I don't need to add anything to it. The questions are vital for everyone to have answers to:

    <ul>

    	<li>What gives your life meaning and joy?</li>

    	<li>What are your biggest fears and concerns?</li>

    	<li>What are you looking forward to?</li>

    	<li>What goals are most important to you now?</li>

    	<li>What trade-offs or sacrifices are you willing to make to achieve those goals?</li>

    Make sure that you, as the future patient, have answers to these questions AND that you have shared them with someone who will be making decisions on your behalf. Having this information locked inside your heart is going to do no one any good if you have not shared it with family or friends.

    And all of this leads me back to my chemotherapy decision. I had my last PET scan a couple of weeks ago if you remember. And the liver spots had shown a decrease in activity. I was supposed to have been back to my oncologist  by now but had to reschedule my appointment. I am planning to see her today, Thursday, to discuss future treatment. I have decided I do not want to try either of the two chemos that she suggested to me when I had such a bad reaction to the Kadcyla. I am, however, going to accept a markedly reduced dosage and determine how I feel afterward. My family knows of this decision. I am not sure how they feel about it but they accept it and stand behind me while we see what happens. We all understand that they might not make the same decision, but they understand that it is the decision I need to make for me. </p>

    <h2>Football and Copperheads</h2>
    <h3>Februrary 13th, 2015</h3>

    <p>So Mom called after the "purple horse" story to relive that crazy evening. Although I am accused of hyperbole, that story was exactly the way that it happened. I mean, who could have made that up? As we talked along, she told me it was a beautiful day in NC and it was time she went out to "pull a few weeds." While other women go and get pedicures to relax, Mom likes to go out and rip up stuff out of the ground. Though I have told you of the many ways we are similar, we are NOT similar when it comes to getting crud under our nails. When I asked her why in February she needed to go out yet again and pull stuff up, she answered, "Because right now the little snakes are asleep. If I wait until spring, they will be awake and might try to bite me."</p>

Which reminded me of a story from last year. Mom had been out yet again in the winter doing whatever she does out there and came upon a copperhead who I guess had forgotten to turn his clock back and was wide awake apparently looking for a fight. Well, when Mom doesn't have a chainsaw in her hand, she usually has a shovel. And good thing she did that day.  While Pop was deep into a football game siting on the sofa, Mom was out in the front yard decapitating a copperhead with her sturdy shovel. Never one to make a big deal out of killing snakes, she pushed it aside and kept working.

Later that afternoon, she came inside, Pop was well into another game and she said, "Jim I killed a copperhead a while ago in the yard." And if you love football or know someone who does, you learn you do not talk to the football fan and if you expect conversation, it usually  sounds like cavemen grunts unless you ask them during halftime. It wasn't halftime and apparently Dad grunted. Mom, still being very new to this marriage thing didn't think that was reverence enough for what she had gone and done to keep home and hearth safe. So she went outside, scooped up the beheaded snake and served it to him on a shovel in the family room.

I am not privy to what he said, but I understand she got both his attention and his respect!</p>

    <h2>Treatment Update</h2>
    <h3>February 13th, 2015</h3>

    <p>I just got home from seeing my oncologist. Due to a couple of scheduling mix-ups, it had been several weeks as you know since I had been to see her. I heard through the nurse grapevine that everyone thought I had ditched the whole thing and had gone off to I am not sure where! A great story but obviously not true. After showing my physician my black eye, we talked chemo. I swear to you that she got a little misty-eyed when I told her I was willing to try the lowered dose Kadcyla - - once! And then to see how I reacted. So that's what I did.

    I am back home. I've had dinner, scratched the cats and am sitting here feeling like there is a ticking time bomb in my belly. Not really...</p>
