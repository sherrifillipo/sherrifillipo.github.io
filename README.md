Sherri's blog, now on github pages

Due to support through github pages, there was no need to support any sort of backend server. The Java code included in this library
is purely for file conversion.

I used Java to parse and assess an XML file; an alternate user downloaded the Wordpress XML file and transferred it to me. The conversions
are being carried out as follows (4/3/2017), with the format XML Tag --> HTML Tag:
    1) item --> body
    2) pubDate --> h3
    3) content --> p
    4)
